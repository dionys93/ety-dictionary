GROUP 1 IRREGULAR VERBS: CONJUGATION PATTERNS

Pattern 1: E-Droppers

These verbs follow regular present tense conjugation:

Present:
  I burste
  you burste
  hie/sie/it burstes
  þey burste 

These verbs drop the final '-e' for past tense and participle while maintaining the same consonant ending.
 ta burste → burst
 ta caste → cast 
 ta còste → còst 
 ta hurte → hurt 
 ta leade → lead 
 ta pûte → pût 

Past (drops -e):
  I burst
  you burst
  hie/sie/it burst
  þey burst


Pattern 2: TE/DE-Modifiers

These verbs have special conjugation patterns in both present and past tenses.

In present tense, these verbs:
  Drop the final '-te' or '-de' for singular subjects
  Add '-s' for third-person singular

  þey cutte


In past tense, these verbs:
  Drop the final '-te' or '-de' for all subjects
  Add an accent mark to 'e'

  I cut
  you cut
  hie/sie/it cut
  þey cut
