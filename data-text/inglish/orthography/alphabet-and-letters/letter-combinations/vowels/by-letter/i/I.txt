I

PRONUNCIATION
The letter I represents three sounds:
• /ɪ/ — as in "bit" (when stressed)
• /ə/ — as in "individual" (when unstressed)
• /i/ — as in "machine" (before silent E or word-final)

RULES

1. Single Vowel = /ɪ/
When I is the only vowel in a word, it's pronounced /ɪ/.

Examples:
    bit, fit, hit, kit, mit, pit, sit, zit

2. I + Two Consonants = /ɪ/
I is always /ɪ/ when followed by two consonants.

Examples:
    sick, rich
    ditch → dich
    to commit → to comitte
    to convict → to convicte
    permission, commission
    citizen → citasan

3. Stressed I in -ION Nouns = /ɪ/
I is stressed /ɪ/ in nouns ending in -ION.

Examples:
    condition → condicion
    ambition → ambicion
    conviction → conviccion
    fiction → ficcion
    addiction → adiccion
    addition → addicion

4. Unstressed I = /ə/
When not stressed, I is pronounced /ə/.

Example:
    individual → indiviᶁual /ˌɪndəˈvɪdʒ(ə)wəl/

5. I + Silent E = /i/
When followed by silent E, I is pronounced /i/.

Examples:
    elite → elite
    meme → mime
    machine → maçine
    to see → to sihe
    to repeal → to repile
    to compete → to compite
    to repeat → to repite
    to defeat → to defite
    complete → complite

6. Word-Final I = /i/
When I ends a word, it's pronounced /i/.

Examples:
    recipe → recipi
    anemone → anèmoni
    catastrophe → catàstrofi
    hyperbole → hypêrboli
