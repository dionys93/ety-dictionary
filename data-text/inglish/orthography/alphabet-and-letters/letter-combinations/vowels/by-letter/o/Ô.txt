Ô

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Ô represents four sounds (always stressed):
• /oʊ/ — as in "host" (most common)
• /ɔr/ — before M and N
• /ər/ — before V and sometimes elsewhere
• /ʊ/ — after Ɯ

RULES

1. Basic Ô = /oʊ/
In most contexts, Ô represents stressed /oʊ/.

Examples:
    hypnosis → hipnôsis
    promotion → promôcion
    devotion → devôcion

2. Ô + M/N = /ɔr/
Before M and N, Ô is pronounced /ɔr/.

Examples:
    corn → cône
    storm → stôme
    to conform → ta confôme

3. Ô + V = /ər/
Before V, Ô is pronounced /ər/.

Examples:
    curve → côve
    hors d'oeuvre → ordôve
    to survive → ta sorvîve

Also in some other words:
    worm → ɯôme

4. Ɯ + Ô = /ʊ/
After Ɯ, Ô replaces what would be Û.

Examples:
    woman → ɯôman
    wolf → ɯôlf

TEACHING NOTES
• Basic Ô = stressed /oʊ/
• Special pronunciations before certain consonants
• Ô replaces Û after Ɯ
