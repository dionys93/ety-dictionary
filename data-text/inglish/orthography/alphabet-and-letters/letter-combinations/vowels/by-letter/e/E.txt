E

PRONUNCIATION
The letter E represents three sounds:
• /ɛ/ — as in "bed" (most common when stressed)
• /ə/ — as in "taken" (when unstressed)
• Silent — at word endings

RULES

1. E = /ɛ/ in Three Contexts

a) Before two consonants:
    to wet → ta ɯette
    to set → ta sette
    We set the table → Uie sette þe tâble

b) As the only vowel in a word:
    bed, sled, hed, sted
    Sometimes, he sets the table → Somtîms, hie sets þe tâble

c) As the first stressed vowel:
    elephant → elifant
    empty
    elevator → elevaitor
    every → evry

2. EH = /eɪ/
The combination EH always represents /eɪ/.

Examples:
    weight → ɯeht
    weigh → ɯehe
    sleigh → sleh

3. Silent E
E is silent at the end of words (common in verbs, adjectives, and single-syllable nouns).

Examples:
    late → lâte
    time → tîme
    to combine → ta combîne
    to eat → ta ite
    to complete → ta complite
    to defeat → ta defite
    to seat → ta síte
    to sit → ta sitte
    to trim → ta trimme

4. Unstressed E = /ə/
When not stressed, E is typically /ə/.

Examples:
    taken → tâken
    different → diffrent

TEACHING NOTES
• Stressed E is usually /ɛ/
• Unstressed E is usually /ə/
• Final E is silent
• EH = /eɪ/ always
