EU

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph EU represents three sounds:
• /ju/ — as in "use" (most common)
• /u/ — as in "true" (after certain consonants)
• /ʊ/ — as in "wood" (rare)

RULES

1. Basic EU = /ju/
In most contexts, EU is pronounced /ju/.

Examples:
    few → feue
    view → veue
    union → euñon
    unity → eunetie
    unique → eunique
    to use → to euse
    to confuse → to confeuse
    usual → eus̃ual
    uniform → eunifôm
    uniformity → eunifômetie

2. EU = /u/ After Consonants
After certain consonants (especially R and TR), EU represents /u/.

Examples:
    rule → reule
    true → treue
    truth → treuþ

3. EU = /ʊ/ (Exceptional)
In a few words, EU represents /ʊ/.

Example:
    wood → ɯeud

4. S + EU = /ʃ/
The letter S becomes /ʃ/ when followed by EU.

Examples:
    shoe → seu
    to shoot → to seute

TEACHING NOTES
• EU usually = /ju/ (like "you")
• After R, TR, etc. EU = /u/ (like "oo" in "moon")
• Exception: EU = /ʊ/ in wood (ɯeud)
• S + EU creates the /ʃ/ sound (sh)
