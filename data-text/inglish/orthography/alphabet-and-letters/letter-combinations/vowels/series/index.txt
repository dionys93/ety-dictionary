INGLISH VOWEL SERIES

INTRODUCTION

Inglish organizes vowels into logical categories based on their base letters, replacing the confusing "long/short" terminology of traditional English pedagogy. 
Each series shows all the sounds that can be represented by a particular letter and its variants.

VOWEL CATEGORIES

Letter-Based Series
Each series covers one base letter and all its variations:

- A-Series (A-series.txt) 
  A /æ/, À /æ/, Á /ɑ/, Â /eɪ/
  Combinations: AI, AU, AO, AE

- E-Series (E-series.txt)
  E /ɛ/, È /ɛ/, Ê /ər/
  Combinations: EI, EU, EY

- I-Series (I-series.txt)
  I /ɪ/, Í /i/, Î /aɪ/
  Combinations: IE

- O-Series (O-series.txt)
  O /ɑ/, Ò /ɔ/, Ó /ɑ/, Ô /oʊ/
  Combinations: OA, OI, OU

- U-Series (U-series.txt)
  U /ə/, Ú /u/, Û /ʊ/
  Combinations: UE, UI

Special Categories

- Reduced Vowel (reduced-vowel.txt) - The neutral vowel /ə/ across all letters
- R-Vowels (R-vowels.txt) - R-colored vowels: AR, ER, IR, OR, UR patterns

LEARNING APPROACH

1. Start with One Letter Series - Master all sounds for A, then E, then I, etc.
2. Learn Cross-Letter Patterns - Study compound vowels like AI, AU, OI  
3. Tackle R-Vowels - These combine base vowels with R-coloring
4. Understand Stress Patterns - Learn when to use diacritical marks

KEY PRINCIPLE

Each series answers the question: "I see this letter in text - what sound(s) can it make?" This makes Inglish vowels learnable through systematic spelling-to-sound relationships, unlike English's chaotic system.

For detailed spelling rules and examples, see the individual series files. For comprehensive information about specific sounds, consult the IPA-based reference files.
