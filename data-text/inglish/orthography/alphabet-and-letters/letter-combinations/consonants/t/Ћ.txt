Ћ þ (Thorn)

Ћ is the capitalized letter.
þ is the lowercase.

PRONUNCIATION
The letter þ represents two sounds:
• /ð/ — voiced (between vowels, in function words)
• /θ/ — voiceless (elsewhere)

RULES

1. þ = /ð/ (Voiced)
In function words and typically between vowels.

Function words:
    the → þe
    this → þis
    these → þise
    that → þat
    those → þose
    they → þey
    them → þem
    their → þeir
    there → þere

Between vowels:
    breathe → briþe
    bathe → bâþe
    clothe → cloþe

2. Þ = /θ/ (Voiceless)
In content words and non-intervocalic positions.

Examples:
    breath → breþ
    bath → baþ
    cloth → clòþ
    theory → þirie
    monotheism → monoþýism

Greek-derived words:
    chthonic → þónic
    chthonian → þonian

TEACHING NOTES
• Function words usually have voiced /ð/
• Content words usually have voiceless /θ/
• Between vowels tends toward /ð/
