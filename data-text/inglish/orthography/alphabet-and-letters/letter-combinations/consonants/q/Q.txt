Q

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Q represents three sounds:
• /k/ — after vowels (vowels become long, except A which is /æ/)
• /kw/ — before U + another vowel
• /kj/ — before U-E or Ú

RULES

1. Vowel + Q = /k/
After vowels, Q is pronounced /k/. The preceding vowel is lengthened.

Examples:
    to puke → ta p̃uq
    to joke → ta joq
    parked → parqed

2. Q + U + Vowel = /kw/
Before U and another vowel, Q represents /kw/.

Examples:
    quick, squid, quack
    queen → quine
    squirrel → squêle
    to quack → ta quaque

3. Q + U-E or Ú = /kj/
Before U-E or Ú, Q represents /kj/.

Examples:
    to execute → ta exequte
    execution → exeqúcion

TEACHING NOTES
• Post-vocalic Q = /k/ (lengthens vowel)
• QU + vowel = /kw/
• Q before U-E/Ú = /kj/
