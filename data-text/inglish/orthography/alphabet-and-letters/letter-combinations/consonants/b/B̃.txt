B̃

PRONUNCIATION
The letter B̃ represents one sound:
• /bj/ — as in "ambulance"

EXAMPLES
    ambulance → amb̃ulance
    to rebuke → ta reb̃uq

VARIATION
Sometimes the /bj/ sound is written as B + EU:
    abuse → abeuse

TEACHING NOTES
B̃ = /bj/. Not all /bj/ sounds use B̃ - some use B + EU instead.
