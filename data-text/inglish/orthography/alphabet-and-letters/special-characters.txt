SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN INGLISH

OVERVIEW
Inglish uses several special characters beyond the standard Latin alphabet to represent specific sounds more accurately. 
These characters are borrowed from various sources to create a more phonetic writing system.

THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS

1. Ɯ (TURNED W)
Sound: /w/
Origin: African Reference Alphabet
Purpose: Aesthetically looks like a "double-u" and not a "double-v"

Usage:
- Initial position: what → ɯhat, when → ɯhen
- After O for /oʊ/: flow → floɯ, show → shoɯ
- Cannot be followed by Û (use Ô instead): woman → ɯôman

Why needed: Allows consistent use of U for vowel sounds while having a distinct symbol for the consonant /w/

2. Ћ/þ (THORN)
Sound: /ð/ (voiced) or /θ/ (voiceless)
Origin: Old English and Icelandic
Purpose: Replaces TH digraph

Usage:
- Ћ = capital letter
- þ = lowercase letter
- Voiced /ð/: the → þe, they → þey
- Voiceless /θ/: think → þinke, bath → baþ

3. ʃ (LONG S)
Sound: /s/
Origin: Historical Latin script
Purpose: Marks specific adjective endings

Usage:
- Primarily in adjectives ending in -oʃ
- glorious → glorioʃ
- gracious → grâcioʃ
- Replaces "-ous" endings

Why needed: Visual distinction for this common adjective pattern

TYPING CONSIDERATIONS

These special characters can be typed using:
1. Unicode input methods
2. Specialized keyboard layouts
3. Character substitution software
4. Copy-paste from character maps

TEACHING NOTES

1. Historical Connection
   - Ћ/þ connects to English's Anglo-Saxon roots
   - ʃ recalls medieval manuscript traditions

2. Phonetic Clarity
   - Each special character represents exactly one sound
   - Eliminates spelling ambiguities
   - Makes pronunciation predictable

3. Visual Distinction
   - Special characters signal special pronunciations
   - Helps readers immediately identify sound changes
   - Creates cleaner, more consistent text

The special characters work together with diacritical marks to create a writing system that is both more phonetic and more visually informative than traditional English orthography.
