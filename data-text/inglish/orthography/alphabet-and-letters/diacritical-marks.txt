DIACRITICAL MARKS IN INGLISH

OVERVIEW
Inglish uses five diacritical marks to indicate pronunciation and stress patterns. These marks help create a more phonetic and consistent orthography.

THE FIVE MARKS

1. GRAVE ACCENT ( ̀ )
Purpose: Marks stressed open/lax vowels
Usage:
    À = stressed /æ/ (instead of regular A which could be /æ/ or /ə/)
    È = stressed /ɛ/ (clarifies stress placement)
    Ì = stressed /ɪ/ (shows stress on short I)
    Ò = stressed /ɔ/ (marks the "caught" vowel)
    Ỳ = stressed /ɪ/ (when Y has this sound)

Examples:
    alphabet → àlfabet (stress on first A)
    the rebel → þe rèble (noun stress)
    cost → còst (stressed /ɔ/)

2. ACUTE ACCENT ( ́ )
Purpose: Marks stressed close/tense vowels and special pronunciations
Usage:
    Á = stressed /ɑ/ or /ɑr/ before M/N
    É = stressed /eɪ/
    Í = stressed /i/
    Ó = stressed /ɑ/ (in certain positions)
    Ú = stressed /u/
    Ý = stressed /i/ (when Y has this sound)

Examples:
    father → fáþor (stressed /ɑ/)
    barn → báne (/ɑr/ before N)
    conveyance → convéiance (stressed /eɪ/)
    media → mídia (stressed /i/)
    shampoos → shampús (stressed /u/)

3. CIRCUMFLEX ( ̂ )
Purpose: Marks special vowel qualities, often diphthongs or R-colored vowels
Usage:
    Â = /eɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ê = stressed /ər/
    Î = /aɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ô = stressed /oʊ/ (or /ɔr/, /ər/, /ʊ/ in special contexts)
    Û = stressed /ʊ/

Examples:
    create → criâte (stressed /eɪ/)
    concern → concêne (stressed /ər/)
    find → fînd (/aɪ/)
    post → pôst (stressed /oʊ/)
    cushion → cûcion (stressed /ʊ/)

4. TILDE ( ̃ )
Purpose: Indicates palatalization (addition of /j/ sound)
Usage on consonants:
    B̃ = /bj/
    C̃ = /kj/
    G̃ = /gj/
    H̃ = /hj/
    M̃ = /mj/
    Ñ = /ɲ/
    P̃ = /pj/
    S̃ = /ʃ/ or /ʒ/ (depending on position)
    X̃ = /kʃ/
    Z̃ = /ʒ/

Examples:
    cute → c̃ute (/kj/)
    huge → h̃uge (/hj/)
    music → m̃usic (/mj/)
    vision → vis̃on (/ʒ/ between vowels)
    onion → oñon (/ɲ/)

5. CEDILLA ( ̧ )
Purpose: Modifies consonant pronunciation
Usage:
    Ç before A/O = /s/
    Ç before E/I/U = /ʃ/
    Ḑ = /d͡ʒ/
    Ţ = /t͡ʃ/

Examples:
    publicity → publiçatie (/s/ before A)
    to appreciate → ta apríçiete (/ʃ/ before I)
    procedure → procíḑure (/d͡ʒ/)
    education → eḑucâcion (/d͡ʒ/)
    individual → indiviḑual (/d͡ʒ/)
    nature → nâţure (/t͡ʃ/)
    feature → fieţure (/t͡ʃ/)
    creature → crieţure (/t͡ʃ/)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

1. Stress Marking
   - Diacritical marks primarily indicate stressed syllables
   - Unmarked vowels are typically unstressed
   - In compound words, diacritical marks may appear without stress

2. One Mark Per Syllable
   - Avoid placing diacritical marks on adjacent syllables
   - This prevents visual clutter (e.g., explôsion not explôs̃on)

3. Priority System
   - Stress marking takes precedence over quality marking
   - When both stress and special quality need marking, use the appropriate diacritical

4. Conservation
   - Use diacritical marks only when necessary for clarity
   - Regular spelling patterns don't need marks

TEACHING NOTES
- Grave = open/lax vowels (mouth more open)
- Acute = close/tense vowels (mouth more closed) 
- Circumflex = complex vowels (diphthongs, R-colored)
- Tilde = palatalization (adding Y-sound)
- Cedilla = consonant modification (softening C, affricating D/T)

The system creates visual consistency: related sounds use related marks, making patterns easier to learn and remember.
