Verb and Noun Endings: -re, -ore, and -are

In Inglish, the -re ending is common for both verbs and nouns. 
However, there are specific cases where -ore is used as a verb ending, and -are is reserved for certain etymological roots.

1. The -re Ending:

    The -re ending is the most common for both verbs and nouns in Inglish.
    It applies unless the word follows specific phonetic rules or comes from particular etymological origins.

Examples:

    water → ɯátre (noun or verb)
    cover → covre (noun or verb)
    murder → murdre (noun or verb)
    matter → matre (noun or verb)
    shatter → shatre (verb)
    scatter → scatre (verb)

2. M or N:

    When a verb contains m or n before the final consonant, the endings -are or -ore ending must be used instead of -re.

Examples:

    to partner → ta partnare (verb)
    to hammer → ta hamore (verb)
    to stammer → ta stamore (verb)

3. The -are Ending:

    Verbs derived from specific etymologies, such as Germanic or Middle Eastern origins, take the -are ending in their verb forms.

Examples:

    s̃ugar (noun) → ta s̃ugare (verb)
    ɯeþar (noun) → ta ɯeþare (verb)
