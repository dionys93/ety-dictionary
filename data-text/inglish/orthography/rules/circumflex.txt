The Circumflex Accent in Inglish

In Inglish, the circumflex accent is used on the following vowels: â, î, ê, ô, û. 
It indicates both the pronunciation of the vowel and typically marks the stressed syllable in a word.

The primary IPA pronunciations for each vowel with a circumflex are:

    Ââ: /eɪ/
    Îî: /aɪ/
    Êê: /ər/
    Ôô: /oʊ/
    Ûû: /ʊ/

Examples:

    location → locâcion
    decide → decîde
    confirm → confême
    hypnosis → hipnôsiʃ
    cushion → cûcion


The vowels î, ê, ô, û can have secondary pronunciations when combined with certain vowels or consonants:

    aî: /ɛr/
    eî: /ɛr/ (rare)
    aê: /aɪər/ (rare)
    ô: /ɔr/, /ər/, or /ʊ/
    oû: /ər/
    aû: /ɔr/

These secondary pronunciations typically occur before the consonants m and n.

Examples:

    impair, impairment → empeire, empeîment
    iron → aêne
    compare, comparison, comparable → compaire, compaîasson, compaîable
    wear, wearable → ɯaire, ɯaîable
    turn → toûne
    burn → boûne
    urn → oûne
    courage → coûage
    earn → ta êne
    warm → ɯaûm
    swarm → sɯaûme
    warn → ta ɯaûne

Special Cases

    aû is also used in words of French origin:
        award → aɯaûd
        reward → reɯaûd
        warden → ɯaûden

    ô behaves differently in various contexts:
        /ɔr/ before m or n:
            corn → cône
            scorn → scône
            form → fôme
        /ər/ before v:
            curve → côve
        /ər/ in certain words:
            worm → ɯôme
        /ʊ/ after ɯ in specific words (for orthographic consistency):
            woman → ɯôman
            wolf → ɯôlfe
