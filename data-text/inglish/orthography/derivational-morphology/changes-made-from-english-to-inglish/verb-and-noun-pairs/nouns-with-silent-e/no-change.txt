Nouns and Verbs in Inglish: No Difference

In Inglish, certain words retain the same form whether they are used as verbs or nouns. 
This applies to words that end in -ce, -ge, -se, -ve, or -ze.

Examples:

    ta côve -> þe côve
    ta chânge → þe chânge
    ta dance → þe dance
    ta horse (araond) → þe horse
    ta force → þe force
    ta chance → þe chance
    ta rânge → þe rânge
    ta massag̃e → þe massag̃e


Some verbs require the addition of a suffix to form their corresponding noun. 
Many nouns ending in -ment come from Old French, where the suffix was used to express the result or action of a verb. 
The suffix -ment was borrowed into English and ultimately traces back to Latin -mentum, serving the same purpose.

Examples:

    ta enhance → þi enhancement
    ta advance → þi advancement
    ta enforce → þi enforcement
