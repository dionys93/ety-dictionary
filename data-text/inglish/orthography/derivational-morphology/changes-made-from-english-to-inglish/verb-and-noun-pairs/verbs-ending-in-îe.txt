            Example: aplîe → aplîant, aplicâcion

Etymological Influence of Old French on English

The significant influence of Old French on the English language dates back to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. 
The Norman rulers brought Old French, which became the language of the court, law, and the upper classes. 
As a result, many Old French words were adopted into Middle English, enriching the vocabulary and affecting spelling and grammar.

The -îe verbs listed above are prime examples of this linguistic blending:

    Legal and Formal Terms:
        Words like trîal and denîal reflect legal concepts introduced by the Normans.

    Verbs of Communication:
        Replîe and complîe are associated with formal communication and agreement.

    Expressions of Emotion and Action:
        Crîe and defîe convey actions and emotions, adding depth to personal expression.

Understanding the Old French origins of these words helps explain their spelling patterns and meanings in Inglish. 
The retention of certain suffixes and the transformation of verbs into nouns and adjectives reflect historical usage and etymology.
