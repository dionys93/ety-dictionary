Nouns and Verbs in Inglish: -q

In Inglish, verbs ending in -q follow specific conjugation patterns, which may be either regular or irregular. 
Separately, these verbs have distinct noun forms, where the -q is replaced by -c in the singular and -cs in the plural, ensuring clear visual differentiation between verbs and nouns.


Verb Conjugation
 
Regular verbs follow consistent patterns, while irregular verbs exhibit stem changes. 

    Regular Verb Conjugation: Verbs keep the -q in the present tense, use -cs in the third-person singular, and -qing for the present participle. The past tense is formed by adding -ed.

    Irregular Verb Conjugation: Verbs such as ta ɯâq use -oq in the past tense and -oqen for the past participle.


Distinguishing Verbs and Nouns in Written Form

For nouns derived from -q verbs, the -q is dropped, and the noun takes -c in the singular form and -cs in the plural.
In certain cases, historical patterns persist, such as spiech as the noun form of spieke, similar to how speech comes from speak. 
This clear difference in spelling provides a straightforward way to distinguish between a verb and its corresponding noun.
