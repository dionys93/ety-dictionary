Middle English kn- from Old English cn-

The silent "k" in English words like "knight," "knee," and "know" originates from Old English, where the "k" was originally pronounced. 
Over time, during the transition to Middle English, the initial "k" sound before "n" became silent, but the spelling was retained. 
This historical pronunciation change is preserved in modern English, maintaining the traditional orthography despite the silent "k."

Inglish drops this -k wherever it is not currently pronounced.

Examples:
    knee: From Old English "cneow"
    knife: From Old English "cnif"
    knight: From Old English "cniht"
    know: From Old English "cnāwan"
    knot: From Old English "cnotta"
    knock: From Middle English "knokken"
    knob: From Middle English "knobbe"
    kneel: From Old English "cnēowlian"
    knack: From Middle English "knak"
    knuckle: From Middle English "knokel"
    acknowledge: From Middle English "aknowen" (a- + knowen)
