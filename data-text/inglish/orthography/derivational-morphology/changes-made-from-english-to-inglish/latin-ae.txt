Modern English -ae and -oe from Latin

The use of "-ae" and "-oe" in English comes from Latin, where these combinations represented specific diphthongs. 
English retained these spellings, especially in scientific, medical, and academic contexts, to preserve their classical origins. 
In Modern English, the pronunciation has simplified, often becoming a single vowel sound, 
and American English frequently replaces "-ae" and "-oe" with "e".
