Definite and Indefinite Articles in Inglish

Inglish uses a gender-based article system inspired by Romance languages, with special consideration for phonetic harmony. 
Articles change form based on the gender of the noun (masculine or feminine), whether the noun begins with a vowel or consonant sound, and the stress pattern of the word.

Definite Articles

1. þe - Used with masculine nouns beginning with consonants. Their stress is on the first syllable.
2. þa - Used with feminine nouns beginning with consonants. Their stress is NOT on the first syllable.
3. þi - Used with ALL nouns beginning with vowels (overrides gender and stress)

Note: Words beginning with "eu-" sound are treated as consonants and follow regular gender rules: þe eunicôn (masc), þa euniversetie (fem)


Indefinite Articles

The indefinite articles follow easy phonetic rules:

"a" - comes before consonant sounds and the vowel sound "eu-". Examples: a dog, a haoss, a eunicôn, a europían citie

"an" - comes before vowel sounds (except "eu-"). Examples: an egg, an ombrella, an ónest person, an aour


Articles with Adjectives

When an adjective comes between the definite article and noun:
- The definite article agrees with the NOUN's gender, not the adjective
- EXCEPT: If the adjective starts with a vowel, use "þi" for phonetic harmony
- Example: þe big boy, þa small church, BUT þi old church
- Indefinite articles follow phonetic harmony: 'a' before consonants or "eu-", 'an' before vowels.
