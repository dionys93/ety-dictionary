Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

In Inglisce, most one-syllable adjectives form the comparative by adding -ar and the superlative by adding -est.
Examples:

    small → smallar → smallest
    tall → tallar → tallest
    pinc → pincar → pinquest 
    blac → blacar → blaquest 
    oît → oîtar → oîtest 
    ôld → ôldar → oldest
    sad → sadar → sadest
    smart → smartar → smartest
    stròng → stròngar → stronguest
    lòng → lòngar → longuest
    big → bigar → bighest
    yong → yongar → yonghest

Two-Syllable Adjectives:

For many two-syllable adjectives, it is more common to use "more" and "moast" to form the comparative and superlative. 
However, some adjectives, particularly those ending in -le or -o, can still take -ar and -est.

Examples:

    simple → simplar → simplest
    gentle → gentlar → gentlest
    nâro → nârouar → nârouest

Adjectives Ending in -y:

Adjectives ending in -y form the comparative with -ier and the superlative with -iest.

Examples:

    pritty → prittiar → prittiest
    lîvely → lîveliar → lîveliest
    daidly → daidliar → daidliest
    míty → mítiar → mítiest
    ângry → ângriar → ângriest

Other Adjectives:

For adjectives that do not take -er or -est, the words "more" and "most" are used to indicate the comparative and superlative.

Examples:

    more sîlent → moast sîlent
    more cairful → moast cairful
    more clever → moast clevre
    more sevire → moast sevire

Special Notes:

    -uer and -uest are used for adjectives with long vowels.
    -her and -hest are used for adjectives with short vowels.
    For certain adjectives, ɯ is added between o and e to form the comparative and superlative.
