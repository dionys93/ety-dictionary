GROUP 1 IRREGULAR VERBS: CONJUGATION PATTERNS

These verbs historically maintain the same form across present, past, and past participle in traditional English (e.g., put-put-put, cut-cut-cut). 
In Inglisce, they follow two distinct conjugation patterns based on their stem structure.

PATTERN A: STRONG STEMS
-----------------------
Verbs with stems ending in doubled consonants that can stand alone: splitte, ridde, hitte, bidde, fitte, pitte

Conjugation:
• Infinitive: to splitte (add -e to stem)
• Simple Present: I split, sie splits, uie splitte, þey splitte, you split/splitte
• Simple Past/Past Participle: I split, sie split, uie split, þey split, you split

Key: The base form matches the stem; -e appears only in infinitive and plural present.

PATTERN B: E-DEPENDENT STEMS  
-----------------------------
Verbs whose stems require -e in present tense: pûte, caste, còste, hurte, qüite, bêste, lete, sete, cöte, bete, șote, leade, sprede, scede, ouede

Conjugation:
• Infinitive: to caste
• Simple Present: I caste, sie castes, uie caste, þey caste, you caste  
• Simple Past/Past Participle: I cast, sie cast, uie cast, þey cast, you cast 

Key: The -e is part of the base present form and drops to form the past (hence "E-Droppers").

SPECIAL CASES
-------------
• lete → lait - shows vowel alternation in past rather than simple e-dropping

REGULAR SUFFIXES
----------------
Both patterns use regular suffixes:
• 3rd person singular present: -s (splits, castes, betes)
• Present participle: -ing (splitting, casting, beting)

ETYMOLOGY NOTE
--------------
These verbs come from diverse sources (Old English, Old Norse, Old French, Dutch) but have converged on this no-change pattern in English. 
Inglisce distinguishes between strong stems (Pattern A) that can stand alone and e-dependent stems (Pattern B) that need support in present tense.
