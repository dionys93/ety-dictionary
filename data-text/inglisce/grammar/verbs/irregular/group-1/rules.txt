GROUP 1 IRREGULAR VERBS: CONJUGATION PATTERNS

Pattern 1: E-Droppers

These verbs follow regular present tense conjugation:

Present:
  I bêste
  you bêste
  hie/sie/it bêstes
  þey bêste 

These verbs drop the final '-e' for past tense and participle while maintaining the same consonant ending.
 to bêste → bêst
 to caste → cast 
 to coste → cost 
 to hurte → hurt 
 to leade → lead 
 to pûte → pût 

Past (drops -e):
  I bêst
  you bêst
  hie/sie/it bêst
  þey bêst


Pattern 2: TE/DE-Modifiers

These verbs have special conjugation patterns in both present and past tenses.

In present tense, these verbs:
  Drop the final '-te' or '-de' for singular subjects
  Add '-s' for third-person singular
  Keep the full form with '-te' or '-de' for plural subjects


Example: "to cutte":
  I cöte
  you cöte
  hie/sie/it cötes 
  uie cöte
  you guys cöte
  þey cöte


In past tense, these verbs:
  Drop the final '-te' or '-de' for all subjects
  Add an accent mark to 'e'

Example: "to cutte":
  I cut
  you cut
  hie/sie/it cut
  þey cut
