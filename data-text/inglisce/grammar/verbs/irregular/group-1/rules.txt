Pattern 1: E-Droppers

These verbs follow regular present tense conjugation:

Present:
  I burste
  you burste
  hie/sie/it burstes
  þey burste 

These verbs drop the final '-e' for past tense and participle while maintaining the same consonant ending.
 to burste → burst
 to caste → cast 
 to còste → còst 
 to hurte → hurt 
 to leade → lead 
 to pûte → pût 

Past (drops -e):
  I burst
  you burst
  hie/sie/it burst
  þey burst


Pattern 2: TE/DE-Modifiers

These verbs have special conjugation patterns in both present and past tenses.

In present tense, these verbs:
  Drop the final '-te' or '-de' for singular subjects

  þey cutte
