Regular verbs conjugate in three main combinations. 
For our example, we'll use the verb "to châce" (Modern English: to chase).

1. 3rd Person Singular Present Tense: Sie châces þe cat.
2. Past Tense Form: Sie châced þe cat. I châced þe cat. You châced þe cat.
3. Progressive Tenses: Sie's châcing þe cat. Ћey uere châcing þe cat; etc

All verbs carry their stress on the second syllable of the word, unless otherwise specified by accent mark.
Some exceptions exist, but not many.
