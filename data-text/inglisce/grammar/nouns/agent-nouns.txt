Agent Nouns in Inglisce

In English, agent nouns are commonly formed using the suffixes -or and -er, which describe a person or thing performing an action:

  -or is of Latin origin and is used in both English and other Romance languages like Spanish and Portuguese.
  -er has Germanic roots and is widely used in English.

In Inglisce, the suffixes -eur/-uer/-eor (from French) and -or (from Latin) are used to form agent nouns. 
The selection between these suffixes is determined by stress placement within the word and sometimes provides additional nuance.
Certain monosyllabic verbs accommodate both -eur and -or suffixes to convey semantic distinctions. 
The -eur suffix indicates human agency, while -or designates instrumental or functional objects.


1. The Suffixes -eur/-eor: 

-eur/-uer forms agent nouns denoting people who perform actions, with stress maintained on the vowel preceding the suffix
-eor/-or forms agent nouns denoting instrumental or functional objects, with stress likewise falling on the vowel preceding the suffix

Examples:

  to acte → acteur
  to bâcue → bâcuer
  to cline → clineur (professional role), *clínor (a cleaning product)
  to commande → commandeur (stress on "an")
  to compacte → compacteor (stress on "act")
  to compute → computeor (stress on "ut")
  to dîne → dîneur (person), dînor (a small restaurant)
  to infecte → infecteor (stress on "ect")
  to ouacue → ouacuer (a person), ouacor (a walking device typically for the disabled or elderly)
  to painte → painteur
  to rîte → rîteur
  to singue → singuer
  to spieke → spiquer (a person), spiecor (an audio device)
  to strime → strimeur (professional role), *strímor (paper product for parties)
  to sêve → sêveur (professional role), sêvor (computer function)
  to tieche → tiecheur

*Stress remains on the first syllable, with the letter i receiving an acute accent to symbolize length and stress.


2. Verbs with -ait endings form agent nouns by adding -or, with primary stress consistently on the first syllable:

Examples:
  to animait → animaitor
  to dictait → dictaitor
  to demonstrait → demonstraitor
  to donait → donaitor
  to navigait → navigaitor


3. Words bearing accent marks to indicate the placement of stress will utilize the -or suffix:

  îcónograph → îconógraphor
  fôtograph → fotógraphor
