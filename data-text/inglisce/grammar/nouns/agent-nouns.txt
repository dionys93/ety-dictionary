Agent Nouns in Inglisce

In English, agent nouns are commonly formed using the suffixes -er (Germanic origin) and -or (Latin origin), which describe a person or thing performing an action: teacher, actor, computer.

Inglisce uses two main suffix groups to form agent nouns:
- -eur/-uer (from French) - for human agents
- -or/-eor (from Latin) - for tools, devices, and some special cases

The choice depends on both meaning and stress patterns.

1. Human Agents vs. Tools

-eur/-uer: human agents (people who perform actions)
  to acte → acteur
  to bâcue → bâcuer
  to commande → commandeur
  to painte → painteur
  to rîte → rîteur
  to singue → singuer
  to tieche → tiecheur

-or/-eor: tools or devices
Examples: computeor, infecteor 

Note: Some verbs can take both suffixes, creating different meanings:
  • clineur (person) vs. clínor (cleaning product)
  • dîneur (person) vs. dînor (small restaurant)
  • ouacuer (person) vs. ouacor (walking device for disabled/elderly)
  • spiquer (person) vs. spiecor (audio device)
  • strimeur (professional role) vs. strímor (party streamer decoration)
  • sêveur (professional role) vs. sêvor (function on computer)

When -or is added to a monosyllabic verb, stress remains on the first syllable and receives an acute accent (í) to mark length and stress.


2. Verbs Ending in -ait

Verbs with -ait endings add -or to form agent nouns, with primary stress on the first syllable:
  to animait → animaitor
  to demonstrait → demonstraitor
  to dictait → dictaitor
  to donait → donaitor
  to navigait → navigaitor


3. Words with Existing Accent Marks

Words that already have accent marks indicating stress placement use the -or suffix:
  îcónograph → îconógraphor
  fôtograph → fotógraphor


4. Germanic Nouns

Some complete words of Germanic origin (not derived from verbs) take -or when borrowed into Inglisce:
  sister → sistor
  hammer → hamor

These are not agent nouns formed from verbs, but rather existing nouns that adopt the -or ending in Inglisce.
