Agent Nouns in Inglish

In English, agent nouns are commonly formed using the suffixes -or and -er, which describe a person or thing performing an action:

  -or is of Latin origin and is used in both English and other Romance languages like Spanish and Portuguese.
  -er has Germanic roots and is widely used in English.

In Inglish, the suffixes -eur (from French) and -or (from Latin) are used to form agent nouns. 
The selection between these suffixes is determined by stress placement within the word and whether the noun denotes a person or an object.

1. The Suffixes -eur/-eor: 

-eur forms agent nouns denoting people who perform actions, with stress maintained on the vowel preceding the suffix
-eor forms agent nouns denoting instrumental or functional objects, with stress likewise falling on the vowel preceding the suffix

Examples:

  to acte → acteur
  to bâke → bâkeur
  to dîne → dîneur
  to commande → commandeur (stress on "an")
  to painte → painteur
  to singue → singueur
  to spieke → spiekeur
  to tieche → tiecheur
  to ɯrîte → ɯrîteur
  to ɯauke → ɯaukeur (a person)
  to sêve → sêveur (professional role)
  to cline → clineur (professional role)
  to strime → strimeur (professional role)

  to comp̃ute → comp̃uteor (stress on "ut")
  to compacte → compacteor (stress on "act")
  to infecte → infecteor (stress on "ect")


2. The Suffix "-or":

Certain monosyllabic verbs accommodate both -eur and -or suffixes to convey semantic distinctions. 
The -eur suffix indicates human agency, while -or designates instrumental or functional objects.
Stress remains on the first syllable, with the letter i receiving an acute accent to symbolize length and stress.

Examples:

  to dîne → dînor (a small restaurant)
  to spieke → spiekor (an audio device)
  to type → typɯrîteor (a machine for typing)
  to ɯauke → ɯaukor (a walking device)
  to sêve → sêvor (computer function)
  to strime → strimeor (paper product for parties)
  to cline → clineor (cleaning product)


3. Verbs with -ait endings form agent nouns by adding -or, with primary stress consistently on the first syllable:

Examples:
  to animait → animaitor
  to dictait → dictaitor
  to demonstrait → demonstraitor
  to donait → donaitor
  to navigait → navigaitor


4. Words bearing accent marks to indicate the placement of stress will utilize the -or suffix:

  îkónograff → îkonógrafor
  fôtograff → fotógrafor
