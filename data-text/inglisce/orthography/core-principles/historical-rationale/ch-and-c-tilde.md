## Rationale for the Use of CH and C̃ in the Orthography

Inglisce orthography distinguishes two graphemic representations for consonants that have followed different historical paths: C̃, representing the affricate /t͡ʃ/, and CH, representing the velar stop /k/. This distinction reflects the different historical origins of these forms and provides a consistent basis for their use in the system.

### Greek χ and the Origin of CH

In Classical Greek, the letter χ represented an aspirated velar stop, conventionally reconstructed as /kʰ/. When Greek words were borrowed into Latin, Roman scribes introduced the digraph ch as a transliteration device specifically to represent χ. This digraph did not arise from internal Latin sound change and was never part of the native Latin consonant system.

In Latin, ch was pronounced as /k/ (or /kʰ/ in careful speech) and remained restricted to learned, technical, and later ecclesiastical vocabulary. Its phonological value was thus conservative and etymologically anchored to a velar articulation rather than an affricate or palatal sound.

This original function establishes ch as a marker of foreign or learned origin rather than as a reflex of native phonological processes.

### Historical Development of C in Latin

Separately, the Latin letter c represented /k/ in all phonological environments in Classical Latin. During the transition to Vulgar Latin and the early Romance languages, c underwent palatalization before front vowels (/e, i/), producing affricate and fricative outcomes. In several Romance traditions, one common reflex of this process was /t͡ʃ/.

This palatalization was a sound change affecting /k/ (written ⟨c⟩ in Latin), not an orthographic development of ⟨ch⟩. In Romance languages, ⟨ch⟩ was subsequently repurposed to represent the affricate outcome /t͡ʃ/, but this spelling choice postdates and does not motivate the phonological change itself.

### Palatalized C in Old and Middle English

Old English inherited the Latin alphabet and employed c to represent both /k/ and a palatalized consonant. Before front vowels and /j/, c was regularly palatalized, yielding realizations commonly reconstructed as [t͡ʃ] or closely related affricates. This alternation was phonologically conditioned and mirrors, in structural terms, the palatalization of c in Romance, though the processes were independent.

During the Middle English period, French scribal influence increasingly represented the palatalized outcome with the digraph ch, while native c lost its ability to transparently signal palatalization. By Early Modern English, /t͡ʃ/ had become a stable phoneme, but its spelling was distributed across multiple digraphs and trigraphs, obscuring its historical origin.

The grapheme C̃ is therefore justified as a marked continuation of palatalized c, preserving the historical relationship between the affricate /t͡ʃ/ and its source consonant while restoring phonological transparency.

### Orthographic Assignment of CH as /k/

Given its origin as a transliteration of Greek χ and its consistent velar realization in Latin, ch is reassigned the value /k/ in Inglisce. This choice reflects its etymological function rather than its later conventional use in English spelling.

This reassignment also aligns ch with conservative and learned strata of the lexicon, while reserving C̃ for affricate outcomes that historically arose through palatalization of c.

### Orthographic Design Principles

The distinction between C̃ (/t͡ʃ/) and CH (/k/) encodes genealogical origin rather than surface orthographic habit. This system:

- Separates native palatalization from foreign transliteration

- Restores a one-to-one grapheme–phoneme mapping

- Preserves etymological visibility across lexical strata

- Avoids conflating historically unrelated consonantal developments

### Summary

C̃ represents the palatalized reflexes of c attested in both Romance and English traditions, culminating in the affricate /t͡ʃ/. CH, by contrast, derives from the Latin transliteration of Greek χ and retains its conservative velar value. By respecting the independent histories of these graphemes, the orthography achieves historical rigor, internal consistency, and phonological clarity.
