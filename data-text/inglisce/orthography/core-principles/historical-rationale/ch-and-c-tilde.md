## Rationale for the Use of **CH** and **C̃** in the Orthography

Inglisce orthography distinguishes two graphemic representations for consonants with distinct historical trajectories: **C̃**, representing the affricate /t͡ʃ/, and **CH**, representing the velar stop /k/. This distinction reflects the separate origins of these forms and provides a principled basis for their use in the system.

### Greek χ and the Latin Digraph **CH**

In Classical Greek, the letter χ represented an aspirated velar stop, commonly reconstructed as /kʰ/. When Greek words were borrowed into Latin, Roman scribes introduced the digraph *ch* as a transliteration of χ. This digraph was never part of native Latin phonology and did not arise through internal sound change.

In Latin, *ch* was pronounced /k/ (or /kʰ/ in careful speech) and remained restricted to learned, technical, and ecclesiastical vocabulary. Its phonological value was thus conservative and anchored to a velar articulation rather than to an affricate or palatal sound. As such, *ch* in Latin functioned as a marker of foreign or learned origin.

### Germanic Dorsal Consonants and the Use of **CH**

The assignment of **CH** to /k/ in Inglisce is reinforced by Germanic developments. Across West and North Germanic languages, velar consonants derived from Proto-Germanic *k* and *kk* underwent variable phonological outcomes, including stops, fricatives, and geminate forms. Orthographically, these consonants were represented with ⟨k⟩, ⟨ck⟩, and ⟨ch⟩ in different contexts.

Modern German preserves this variability: ⟨ch⟩ represents a velar or post-velar fricative in many environments, while closely related English words retain /k/. Inglisce adopts **CH** in Germanic-derived vocabulary as an intentional orthographic homage to this broader tradition. While pronounced /k/, **CH** signals a dorsal consonant and reflects the historical instability of velars in Germanic orthographies.

| to make        | to mâche       | machen        |
| to bake        | to bâche       | backen        |
| to break       | to breiche      | brechen       |

| to leak        | to lieche       | lecken        |


### Palatalized *C* in Latin and English

Separately, the Latin letter *c* represented /k/ in all phonological environments. In Vulgar Latin and the early Romance languages, *c* underwent palatalization before front vowels (/e, i/), producing affricate or fricative outcomes, often /t͡ʃ/ in later Romance. In some Romance traditions, ⟨ch⟩ was repurposed to represent this affricate, but this orthographic reassignment postdates the phonological change.

Old English employed *c* for both /k/ and a palatalized consonant. Before front vowels and /j/, *c* was regularly palatalized, yielding [c] or affricate-like outcomes that later stabilized as /t͡ʃ/. French scribal influence in Middle English increasingly represented this palatalized outcome with *ch*, while native *c* lost transparency. By Early Modern English, /t͡ʃ/ had become stable, though spelled inconsistently.

The grapheme **C̃** is therefore justified as a marked continuation of palatalized *c*, preserving the historical relationship between the affricate /t͡ʃ/ and its source consonant and restoring transparent one-to-one grapheme–phoneme correspondence.

| Latin | Italian | French | Modern English | Inglisce |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **centum** <br> /ˈkɛn.tum/ | **c**ento <br> /ˈt͡ʃɛn.to/ | **c**ent <br> /sɑ̃/ | cent /sɛnt/           | **c**ente /sɛnt/ |

### Summary

Inglisce assigns graphemes based on historical and phonological evidence:

- **CH** = /k/, reflecting both classical Greek/Latin transliteration (χ → ch) and dorsal consonant developments in Germanic vocabulary  
- **C̃** = /t͡ʃ/, representing palatalized reflexes of Latin and English *c*  

This system encodes genealogical origin rather than surface spelling conventions. It:

- Separates native palatalization from foreign transliteration  
- Restores transparent grapheme–phoneme mapping  
- Preserves etymological visibility across lexical strata  
- Avoids conflating historically unrelated consonantal developments  

By integrating the classical, Germanic, and palatalization evidence into a single rationale, Inglisce achieves an orthography that is **historically rigorous, phonologically transparent, and internally consistent**, while providing a coherent one-to-one mapping between graphemes and sounds.
