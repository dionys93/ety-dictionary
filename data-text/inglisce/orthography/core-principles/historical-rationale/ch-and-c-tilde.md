## Rationale for the Use of **CH** and **C̃** in the Orthography

The orthography distinguishes two graphemic representations for the affricate /t͡ʃ/ and the velar stop /k/: **C̃** and **CH**, respectively. This distinction is grounded in the historical development of the letter *C* in both Latin and Old English and reflects a principled approach to mapping diachronic sound change onto a synchronic writing system.

### Historical Development of *C*

In Classical Latin, the letter *C* represented /k/ in all environments. In the evolution of Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, however, so-called *hard c* underwent palatalization before front vowels, producing affricate and fricative outcomes, including /t͡ʃ/ in several daughter languages.

A parallel development occurred in Old English. The letter *C* could represent /k/ or a palatalized consonant, often realized as /t͡ʃ/ or a related sound, depending on phonological environment. This alternation was systematic and historically motivated rather than arbitrary.

The grapheme **C̃** is therefore justified as a direct continuation of these palatalized *C* outcomes. The tilde marks the letter as a modified form of *C*, signaling historical palatalization while maintaining a clear visual and conceptual link to the base grapheme.

### Justification for **CH** as /k/

The digraph **CH** has a distinct and independent history. In Latin orthography, **CH** was introduced specifically to transliterate Greek χ and was pronounced /k/ rather than as an affricate. This conservative /k/ value persisted in learned borrowings and technical vocabulary.

In the Germanic tradition, Old English words containing a “hard ch” sound (historically /x/ or /k/-like articulations) underwent further sound changes, with many such forms ultimately merging with /k/ in later stages of English. As a result, **CH** in Germanic-derived vocabulary aligns more naturally with a velar realization than with an affricate.

Assigning **CH** the value /k/ in Inglisce therefore reflects both its classical function as a marker of learned or foreign vocabulary and its convergence with velar consonants in the Germanic sound system.

### Orthographic Design Principles

By assigning **C̃** to /t͡ʃ/ and **CH** to /k/, the orthography encodes historical sound developments rather than surface spelling conventions. This approach:

- Preserves the distinction between palatalized and non-palatalized outcomes of *C*
- Avoids overloading a single grapheme with unrelated phonemic values
- Aligns graphemic choice with well-attested diachronic patterns in both Romance and Germanic languages

### Summary

The use of **C̃** reflects the historical palatalization of *C* in Latin and Old English, while **CH** retains its conservative velar value rooted in Greek transliteration and Germanic phonological development. Together, these choices produce an orthography that is historically grounded, phonologically transparent, and internally consistent.
