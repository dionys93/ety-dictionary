PRONUNCIATION
The letter O represents five sounds:
• /ɑ/ — as in "lock" (before two consonants)
• /oʊ/ — as in "home" (various contexts)
• /ɔ/ — as in "caught" (before H)
• /ə/ — as in "common" (unstressed)
• /ər/ — as in "doctor" (unstressed before R)
/w/

RULES

1. O + Two Consonants = /ɑ/
When followed by two consonants, O is typically /ɑ/.

Examples:
    lock, dock, flock, stock, not
    concoction → concoccion
    to concoct → to concocte
    knot → gnot

2. O = /oʊ/ in Four Contexts

a) Before single consonant + silent E:
    cove, stove, lone, code, prone, zone, cone, fone
    to explode
    to corrode → to corrode
    to condone → to condone
    to suppose → to sopose
    to postpone → to poastpone
    to oppose → to opose
    throne → þrone

b) Before -LD:
    bold, cold, fold, gold, hold, mold, old

c) Word-final in multisyllable words:
    tomorrow → tomòro
    tarot → târo
    sparrow → spâro
    window → ɯindo


    show → seoe
    blow → bloe
    flow → floe

Note: Stressed verbs use -OE:
    to lasso → to lassoe
    to follow → to folloe
    (Gerunds: lassouing, fóllouing)

3. O + H = /ɔ/
OH represents /ɔ/, typically in irregular past tenses.

Examples:
    bought → boht
    fought → foht
    sought → çoht
    thought → þoht

4. Unstressed O = /ə/
When unstressed, O is often /ə/.

Examples:
    monotheism → monothýism /ˌmɑnəˈθiˌɪzəm/
    museum → m̃usíom /mjuˈziəm/
    stadium → stâdiom /ˈsteɪdiəm/
    to condone → to condone /tə kənˈdoʊn/
    to suppose → to sopose /tə səˈpoʊz/
    run → rone /rən/*
    done → don
    to come, have come → to come, have com
    Monday → Monday /ˈmənˌdeɪ/*

*Note: O replaces U between M, N, R (U cannot appear in these positions)

5. Unstressed O + R = /ər/
When unstressed and followed by R, O can be /ər/.

Examples:
    turn → torne
    return → retorne

TEACHING NOTES

• O replaces U after M, N, R



Ò

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Ò represents one sound:
• /ɔ/ — as in "cost" (always stressed)

PURPOSE
Ò marks stressed /ɔ/ in words where stress placement needs clarification.

EXAMPLES
