Ô

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Ô represents four sounds (always stressed):
• /oʊ/ 
• /aʊ/ — before N or U
/ʊ/ before C

RULES

1. Basic Ô = /oʊ/
In most contexts, Ô represents stressed /oʊ/.

Examples:
    hypnosis → hipnôsis

2. Ô + N/U = /aʊ/

Examples:
    sound -> sônd
    around -> arônd
    cow -> côue
    vow -> vôue

3. Ô + C/D = /ʊ/

Examples:
    book → bôc
    cook → côc
    shook -> seôc
    hood -> hôd
    wood -> uôd

4. U + Ô = /ʊ/
After U, Ô replaces what would be Û.

Examples:
    woman → uôman
    wolf → uôlf
    wood -> uôd
