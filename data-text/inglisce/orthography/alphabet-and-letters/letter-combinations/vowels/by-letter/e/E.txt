E

PRONUNCIATION
The letter E represents three sounds:
• /ɛ/ — as in "bed" (most common when stressed)
• /ə/ — as in "taken" (when unstressed)
• Silent — at word endings

RULES

1. E-E = /ɛ/ in Three Contexts

a) Before two consonants:
    to wet → to ouete
    to set → to sete
    We set the table → Uie sete þe tâble

b) As the only vowel in a word:
    bede, slede, hede, 
    Sometimes, he sets the table → Somtîms, hie setes þe tâble

c) As the first stressed vowel:
    elephant → elefant
    empty
    elevator → elevaitor
    every → evry


3. Silent E
E is silent at the end of words (common in verbs, adjectives, and single-syllable nouns).

Examples:
    late → lâte
    time → tîme
    to combine → to combîne
    to eat → to ite
    to complete → to complite
    to defeat → to defite
    to seat → to síte
    to sit → to sitte
    to trim → to trimme

4. Unstressed E = /ə/
When not stressed, E is typically /ə/.

Examples:
    to repair -> to repâre
    to prepare -> to prepâre
    to remember
    member -> membre, membars
    ember -> embre, embers
    different → diffrent
    to despair → to despere, despèring
    desperation -> desperâcion

TEACHING NOTES
• Stressed E is usually /ɛ/
• Unstressed E is usually /ə/
• Final E is silent



È

PRONUNCIATION
The letter È represents one sound:
• /ɛ/ — as in "bed" (always stressed)

PURPOSE
È marks stressed /ɛ/ in words where stress placement needs clarification.

EXAMPLES
    the anemone → þi anèmonie
    the regrets → þa regrèts
    the cigarettes -> þa cigarèts
    infective -> infèctif
    defective -> defèctif



TEACHING NOTES
È = stressed /ɛ/. Used when regular E might not clearly show stress placement.
