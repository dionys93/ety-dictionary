EY

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph EY represents one sound:
• /eɪ/ — as in "they"

RULES

1. Word-Final Position
EY typically appears at the end of nouns and pronouns.

Examples:
    prey
    they → þey
    whey → ɯhey

2. Gerunds from -EIE Verbs
EY appears in gerund forms of verbs ending in -EIE.

Examples:
    to convey → to conveie, conveying
    to obey → to obeie, obeying
    to prey → to preie, preying
    to survey → to sorveie, sorveying
    to purvey → to porveie, porveying
    to sley → to sleie, sleying


Pattern: -EIE verb → -EYING gerund

TEACHING NOTES
• EY = /eɪ/ at word endings
• Gerunds: -EIE verbs become -EYING
