EI/ÉI

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph EI represents two sounds:
• /eɪ/ — as in "convey" (most common)
• /ɛr/ — when followed by R

RULES

1. Basic EI = /eɪ/
In most contexts, EI is pronounced /eɪ/ and appears in verbs.

Verb examples (stressed):
    to convey → to conveie
    to obey → to obeie
    to prey → to preie
    to survey → to sorveie
    to purvey → to porveie

2. EI + R = /ɛr/
When EI is followed by R, it's pronounced /ɛr/.

Verb examples (stressed):
    to impair → to empeire
    to despair → to despeire

Nounexamples (stressed):
    impairment → empeirement

3. Stressed EI = ÉI
When EI is stressed (typically in nouns derived from -eine verbs), it's written as ÉI.

Examples:
    to contain → to conteine
    containment → contéinment
    
    to retain → to reteine
    retainment → retéinment
    
    to entertain → to entreteine
    entertainment → entretéinment

    obeyance → obéiance
    conveyance → convéiance

PATTERN SUMMARY
• Verbs: EI (unstressed /eɪ/) or EIRE (unstressed /ɛr/)
• Nouns from -eine verbs: ÉI (stressed /eɪ/)

ETYMOLOGY EXAMPLE
The -eire pattern comes from Latin through French:
    peior, peiorare [Latin] → impeiorare [Vulgar Latin] → empeirier [Old French] → 
    empeiren [Middle English] → to impair [Modern English] → to empeire [Inglish]

TEACHING NOTES
• Basic EI = /eɪ/ in verbs
• EI + R = /ɛr/
• Stress marking: ÉI for stressed /eɪ/
• Watch for verb-to-noun transformations
