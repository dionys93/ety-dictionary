AU

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph AU represents two sounds:
/ɔ/ — as in "auto" (most common)
/ɔr/ — when followed by R
/æʊ/

RULES

1. Basic AU = /ɔ/
In most contexts, AU is pronounced /ɔ/.

Examples:
    Australia → Austrâlha /ɔˈstreɪljə/
    autumn → automn /ˈɔɾəm/
    automatic → automatic /ˌɔɾəˈmæɾɪk/
    coffee → caufie /'kɔfi/

2. Verb/Noun Distinction
Verbs use -AHE/-AUE while related noun PLURALS use -AUS

Examples:
    to saw → to sahe /tə sɔ/
    the saw → þe sahe, saus /ðə sɔ/
    
    to draw → to drahe /tə drɔ/
    the draw → þe drahe, draus /ðə drɔ/

3. AU + R = /ɔr/
When AU is followed by R, it's pronounced /ɔr/.

Also when flipped, UA + R = /wɔr/
