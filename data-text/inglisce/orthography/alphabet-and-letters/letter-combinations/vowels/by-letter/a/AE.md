# AE

The digraph AE represents a single vowel sound in Inglisce.

### PRONUNCIATION SUMMARY

- **AE** — /aɪ/ "amplify" — amplify → amplifae

### The Digraph AE

#### AE = /aɪ/
AE represents /aɪ/ and appears primarily in verbs derived from Latin "-ficare" stems.

### Latin -FACERE Verbs

AE is most commonly found in words derived from Latin verbs using "facere" (to make/do) as their stem. These correspond to Modern English "-fy" endings.

**Examples:**  
to justify → to justifae /tə ˈdʒəstɪˌfaɪ/  
to amplify → to amplifae /tə ˈæmplɪˌfaɪ/  
to clarify → to clârifae /tə ˈklærɪˌfaɪ/  
to modify → to modifae /tə ˈmɑdɪˌfaɪ/  
to simplify → to simplifae /tə ˈsɪmplɪˌfaɪ/  
to verify → to verifae /tə ˈvɛrɪˌfaɪ/

### Etymology

This pattern derives from the Latin verb ending "-ficare" which evolved through French "-fier" into English "-fy". Inglisce restores a more phonetic spelling with AE consistently representing the /aɪ/ sound.

**Latin Evolution Path:**  
iustificare [Latin] → justifier [French] → justify [English] → justifae [Inglisce]  
amplificare [Latin] → amplifier [French] → amplify [English] → amplifae [Inglisce]

### Teaching Notes

**Primary pattern:**
- English "-fy" verbs → Inglisce "-fae"
- Always pronounced /aɪ/

**Key distinction:**
- AE is specifically for Latin-derived "-ficare" verbs
- Creates consistent pattern for entire verb family

**Memory aid:**
If it ends in "-fy" in Modern English and comes from Latin "-ficare", it becomes "-fae" in Inglisce.
