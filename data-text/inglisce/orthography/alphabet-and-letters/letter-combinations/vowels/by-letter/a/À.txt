À

PRONUNCIATION
The letter À represents one sound:
• /æ/ — as in "cat" (always stressed)

PURPOSE
À marks stressed /æ/ in words where stress placement is irregular or needs clarification.

RULES

1. Irregular Stress Patterns
À shows where /æ/ is stressed in words that don't follow typical English stress patterns.

Examples:
    analysis → anàlysiʃ /əˈnælɪsəs/
    combatant → combàtant /kəmˈbætnt/
    alfalfa → alfàlfa /ælˈfælfə/

2. Disambiguation
À prevents confusion about stress placement that might arise from spelling patterns.

Example:
    alphabet → àlfabet /ˈælfəˌbɛt/
    (Without À, the final E might suggest stress on the preceding vowel)

3. Etymological Corrections
À can mark stress while correcting historical spelling errors.

Example:
    admiral → àmiral /ˈæmərəl/
    (Removes unetymological -d- from Arabic origin word, while clearly marking stress)

TEACHING NOTES
Think of À as stressed A. It's used when regular spelling might mislead readers about where to place emphasis.
