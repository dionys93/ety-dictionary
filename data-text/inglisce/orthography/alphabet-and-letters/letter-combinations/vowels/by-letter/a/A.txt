A

PRONUNCIATION
The letter A represents two sounds:
• /æ/ — as in "cat"
• /ə/ — as in "about"

RULES

1. Stressed A = /æ/
When A is the only stressed vowel in a word, it is pronounced /æ/.

Examples:
    cat, hat, fat, sat
    bat, mat, rap, tap

2. Unstressed A = /ə/
In unstressed positions, A is typically pronounced /ə/.

Examples:
    what → uat /wət/
    mother → maþor /ˈməðər/
    about → abaut /əˈbaʊt/

3. Variable Pronunciation
Some words contain A with both pronunciations depending on stress patterns:

    animate (verb) → to animait /tə ˈænɪˌmeɪt/
    animate (adjective) → animat /ˈænɪmət/
    
    animal /ˈænɪməl/
    practical /ˈpræktɪkəl/
    practicality → practicaletie /ˌpræktɪˈkæləɾi/


TEACHING NOTES
The key to understanding A is recognizing stress patterns. In most cases, stressed A = /æ/ and unstressed A = /ə/.



À

PRONUNCIATION
The letter À represents one sound:
• /æ/ — as in "cat" (always stressed)

PURPOSE
À marks stressed /æ/ in words where stress placement is irregular or needs clarification.

RULES

1. Irregular Stress Patterns
À shows where /æ/ is stressed in words that don't follow typical English stress patterns.

Examples:
    analysis → anàlysiʃ /əˈnælɪsəs/
    combatant → combàtant /kəmˈbætnt/
    alfalfa → alfàlfa /ælˈfælfə/


2. Etymological Corrections
À can mark stress while correcting historical spelling errors.

Example:
    admiral → àmiral /ˈæmərəl/
    (Removes unetymological -d- from Arabic origin word, while clearly marking stress)


Á

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Á represents one sound (both always stressed):
• /ɑ/ — as in "father"

RULES

1. Basic Á = /ɑ/
In most contexts, Á is pronounced /ɑ/.

Examples:
    father → fáþor /ˈfɑðər/
    water → uátre /ˈwɑɾər/
    alarme, alarms → alarme, alárms

TEACHING NOTES
Á is always stressed.
