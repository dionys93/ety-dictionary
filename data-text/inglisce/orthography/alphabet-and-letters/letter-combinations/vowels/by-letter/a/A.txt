A

PRONUNCIATION
The letter A represents two sounds:
• /æ/ — as in "cat"
• /ə/ — as in "about"

RULES

1. Stressed A = /æ/
When A is the only stressed vowel in a word, it is pronounced /æ/.

Examples:
    cat, hat, fat, sat
    bat, mat, rap, tap

2. Unstressed A = /ə/
In unstressed positions, A is typically pronounced /ə/.

Examples:
    what → uat /wət/
    mother → maþor /ˈməðər/
    about → abaut /əˈbaʊt/

3. Variable Pronunciation
Some words contain A with both pronunciations depending on stress patterns:

    animate (verb) → to animait /tə ˈænɪˌmeɪt/
    animate (adjective) → animat /ˈænɪmət/
    
    animal /ˈænɪməl/
    practical /ˈpræktɪkəl/
    practicality → practicaletie /ˌpræktɪˈkæləɾi/


TEACHING NOTES
The key to understanding A is recognizing stress patterns. In most cases, stressed A = /æ/ and unstressed A = /ə/.
