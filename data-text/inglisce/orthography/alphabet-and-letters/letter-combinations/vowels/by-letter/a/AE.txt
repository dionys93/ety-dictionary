AE

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph AE represents one sound:
• /aɪ/ — as in "amplify"

RULES

1. Latin -FACERE Verbs
AE is most commonly found in words derived from Latin verbs using "facere" (to make/do) as their stem.

Examples:
    justify → to justifae /tə ˈdʒəstɪˌfaɪ/
    amplify → to amplifae /tə ˈæmplɪˌfaɪ/
    clarify → to clârifae /tə ˈklærɪˌfaɪ/
    modify → to modifae /tə ˈmɑdɪˌfaɪ/
    simplify → to simplifae /tə ˈsɪmplɪˌfaɪ/
    verify → to verifae /tə ˈvɛrɪˌfaɪ/

ETYMOLOGY
This pattern comes from the Latin verb ending "-ficare" which evolved through French "-fier" into English "-fy". Inglish restores a more phonetic spelling with AE representing the /aɪ/ sound.

Latin Path:
    iustificare [Latin] → justifier [French] → justify [English] → justifae [Inglisce]
    amplificare [Latin] → amplifier [French] → amplify [English] → amplifae [Inglisce]

TEACHING NOTES
Remember: If it ends in "-fy" in Modern English and comes from Latin "-ficare", it becomes "-fae" in Inglisce. 
This creates a consistent pattern for this whole family of verbs.
