AI/AÎ

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph AI represents three sounds:
• /eɪ/ 
• /ɛr/ — when followed by R
• /ɛ/ 

ORIGIN
Typically found in words of French origin, but also appears in some Germanic words.

RULES

1. Basic AI = /eɪ/


Examples:  
    to say → to saie /tə seɪ/
    to pay → to paie /tə peɪ/
    to stay → to staie /tə steɪ/
    to play → to plaie /tə pleɪ/
    animator → animaitor /ˈænɪˌmeɪɾər/
    demonstrator → demonstraitor /ˈdɛmənˌstreɪɾər/

2. AI + GN = Stressed /eɪ/
The stress is always on AI when followed by the letters GN.

Examples:
    gain -> gaigne 
    rain -> raign 
    stain -> staign
    complaint → complaignt /kəmˈpleɪnt/
    campaign → campaign /kæmˈpeɪn/
    champagne → ciampaign /ʃæmˈpeɪn/



Note: The noun forms of these words use -AY instead (say, pay, stay, play)

4. AI + R = /ɛr/
When AI is followed by R, the combination is pronounced /ɛr/.

Verb examples (unstressed):
    to care → to caire /tə kɛr/
    to pair → to paire /tə pɛr/
    to compare → to compaire /tə kəmˈpɛr/
    stairs → stairs /stɛrz/

Noun/adjective examples (stressed, written as AÎ):
    comparison → compaîrasson /kəmˈpɛrəsən/
    comparable → compaîrable /kəmˈpɛrəbəl/
    comparative → compaîratif /kəmˈpɛrəɾɪv/



EXCEPTIONS
AI represents /ɛ/ in a few words:
    lettuce → laitace
    to catch → to caiche

TEACHING NOTES
The key patterns to remember:
• AI = /eɪ/ in most cases
• AI + R = /ɛr/ (unstressed: AIR, stressed in derivatives: AÎR)
• Verbs use -AIE, nouns use -AY
• Watch for stress on AI before GN
• Verb derivatives with -AIRE become -AÎR- in nouns/adjectives
