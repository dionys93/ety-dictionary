Y

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Y represents two sounds:
• /i/ — at word endings (adjectives and adverbs only)
• /aɪ/ — when part of YH digraph

RULES

1. Word-Final Y = /i/ 
In adjectives and adverbs, final Y is pronounced /i/.

Examples:
    happy, pretty, quickly, slowly

2. YH = /aɪ/
The combination YH represents /aɪ/.

Examples:
    to dye → to dyhe
    sky → skyh
    to buy → to byhe
    to tie → to tyhe
    tight → tyht
    to sigh → to syhe
    rye → ryh

TEACHING NOTES
• Final Y in adjectives/adverbs = /i/
• YH always = /aɪ/



Ỳ

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Ỳ represents one sound:
• /ɪ/ — as in "bit" (always stressed)

PURPOSE
Ỳ marks stressed /ɪ/ in words where Y represents this sound.

EXAMPLES
    to knit → ta nỳte
    analytical → analỳtical

TEACHING NOTES
Ỳ = stressed /ɪ/. Used when Y has the /ɪ/ sound and needs stress marking.
