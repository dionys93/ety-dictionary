NOTATION CONVENTIONS FOR INGLISCE ORTHOGRAPHY DOCUMENTATION

This file explains the notation system used throughout the orthography files.

====================================

TRANSFORMATION NOTATION

The arrow (→) indicates spelling transformation from standard English to Inglisce where applicable.

Format: [English spelling] → [Inglisce spelling]

Examples:
cat (no change)
make → mâcue (spelling change)
father → fáþor (multiple changes)

====================================

PRONUNCIATION NOTATION

IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols appear between forward slashes.
Example words appear in quotation marks after the IPA.

Format: /IPA symbol/ "example word"

Examples:
/æ/ "cat" — the vowel sound in "cat"
/ə/ "about" — the schwa sound in "about" 
/aɪ/ "kite" — the diphthong in "kite"

====================================

STRESS NOTATION

Stressed: The syllable that receives primary emphasis in pronunciation.
Unstressed: Syllables with reduced emphasis, often changing vowel quality.

Stress affects pronunciation:
- Stressed A = /æ/ as in "cat"
- Unstressed A = /ə/ as in "about"

In IPA transcriptions, stress is marked with ˈ before the stressed syllable:
/ˈænɪməl/ — stress on first syllable
/əˈbaʊt/ — stress on second syllable

====================================

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

Each letter file follows this organization:

1. HEADER: Letter name and overview
2. PRONUNCIATION SUMMARY: Quick reference table
3. MAIN RULES: Detailed contexts and patterns
4. DIACRITICS: Special marked versions
5. CROSS-REFERENCES: Links to related files

Rule sections use these formats:

Context-Based Headers:
"Stressed A = /æ/"
"A + Silent E = /eɪ/"
"Word-Final I = /i/"

Example Lists:
- Single line for short words: cat, hat, mat, bat
- Transformation pairs: father → fáþor
- Grouped by pattern for clarity

====================================

CROSS-REFERENCE NOTATION

References to other files help navigate related sounds and patterns.

Formats used:
- "See [filename]" — for primary references
- "Related to [filename]" — for secondary connections  
- "Compare with [filename]" — for contrasts

File naming conventions:
- Single letters: A.txt, E.txt
- Digraphs: AI.txt, OU.txt
- IPA sounds: IPA-æ.txt, IPA-ə.txt

====================================

PATTERN NOTATION

Patterns describe letter contexts using:
- Letter names: "A before two consonants"
- + for sequences: "I + Silent E"
- Positions: "Word-final", "Stressed position"
- Word class: "in verbs", "Latin-derived nouns"

Example pattern descriptions:
"O + Two Consonants = /ɑ/"
"Unstressed E + R = /ər/"
"Word-Final Y in adjectives = /i/"
