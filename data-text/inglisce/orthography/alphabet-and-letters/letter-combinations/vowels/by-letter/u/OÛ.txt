OÛ

PRONUNCIATION
The digraph OÛ represents two sounds:
• /ər/ — as in "burn" (before N)
• /ʊ/ — in modal verbs

RULES

1. OÛ + N = /ər/
Before N, OÛ represents stressed /ər/.

Examples:
    the return → þa retoûn
    the burn → þe boûn
    the urn → þi oûn
    the journey → þe joûnie
    the sojourn → þa sojoûn

2. Modal Verbs = /ʊ/
In modal verbs, OÛ represents /ʊ/.

Examples:
    could → coûd
    would → ɯoûd
    should → seûd

TEACHING NOTES
• OÛN = stressed /ər/ + n
• Modal verbs use OÛ for /ʊ/
• Always indicates stress
