TEACHING NOTES

U is highly variable based on context
Most common: U before two consonants = /ə/
U + single consonant + E usually = /u/
U acts as /w/ in SU-, QU- patterns
Silent U keeps G hard before soft vowels
U cannot appear between M, N, R and another letter (use O instead)
Ú = stressed /u/ or /ju/, often appears in plural forms
Û = stressed /ʊ/, cannot appear after U (use Ô)
Ü = /w/ in specific middle-of-word contexts
