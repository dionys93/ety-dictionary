### Base Letter U

#### U = /ə/
When followed by two consonants, or is the only vowel, U is typically /ə/.

**Examples:**  
but, hut, luck → lucc  
to pluck → plucue  
number → nombre /ˈnəmbər/  
murmur → mormor /ˈmərˌmər/

#### U = /u/
Before single consonant + E, U is pronounced /u/.

**Examples:**  
crude → creude, rude → reude  
tube → toube, to illude  
illusion → illúsion

**In specific contexts:**  
blue, avenue, nuance  
congruence, influence

#### U = /ju/
U represents /ju/ in various positions.

**Examples:**  
cute, mute, muse, confuse  
unusual → unúșual

#### U as /w/ in Consonant Clusters
U functions as /w/ in SU- and QU- patterns.

**SU patterns:**  
swerve → suêve, sweat → suète  
suave → suáve, swarm → suarme  
twerk → tuêcue

**QU patterns:**  
quake → cuâcue, to squeak → to squiecue  
to squeal → to squiele, squirmy → squêmy  
squid → squïd

#### Silent U
U is silent when used to keep G hard before I, E, Y.

**Examples:**  
to give → to guive, to guide → to guîde  
gift → guift, geek → guiec, guy

### Restriction: M/N/R Rule
U cannot appear after M, N, or R. O replaces U in these positions but keeps the same /ə/ sound.

**Examples:**  
run → rone /rən/, nun → nonne /nən/  
number → nombre /ˈnəmbər/  
murmur → mormor /ˈmərˌmər/  
Monday /ˈmənˌdeɪ/

This is purely orthographic - the pronunciation remains /ə/.
