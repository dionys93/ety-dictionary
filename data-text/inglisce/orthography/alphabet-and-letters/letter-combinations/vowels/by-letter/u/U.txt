U

PRONUNCIATION
The letter U represents two vowel sounds and one consonant sound:
• /ə/ — as in "cut" (before two consonants or as only vowel)
• /u/ — as in "cute" or "food" (in specific contexts)
• /w/ — as in "quick" (between consonants and vowels)

RULES

    cute
    mute → m̃ute
    muse → m̃use
    creude, reude, toube

4. Silent U
U is silent when used to keep G hard before I, E, Y:
    to give → to guive
    to guide → to guîde

    guy 

SPECIAL NOTE
U cannot appear between M, N, R and another letter. Use O instead in these positions.

• U + single consonant + E = /u/
• U acts as /w/ in SU-, QU- patterns
• Silent U keeps G hard before soft vowels
