U

PRONUNCIATION
The letter U represents two vowel sounds and one consonant sound:
• /ə/ — as in "cut" (before two consonants or as only vowel)
• /u/ — as in "cute" or "food" (in specific contexts)
• /w/ — as in "quick" (between consonants and vowels)

RULES

1. U = /ə/
U is pronounced /ə/ when:
- It's the only vowel in a word
- Two consonants follow it

Examples:
    to cut → to cutte
    I cut the grass → I cut þe grass
    She cuts the grass → Sie cuts þe grass
    He cut the grass → Hie cut þe grass
    We always cut → Uie alɯays cutte þe grass
    They shut the dogs in the room every afternoon → Ћey shutte þe dogs in þe roum evry aftrenoun

2. U = /u/
U is pronounced /u/ in three contexts:

a) Before single consonant + silent E:
    cute → c̃ute
    mute → m̃ute
    muse → m̃use
    crude, rude, tube 
    school → scule

b) Immediately before silent E:
    blue, avenue
   
c) Before another vowel:
    nuance 
    congruence
    influence

3. U as /w/ Sound
U represents /w/ in two contexts:

a) Between consonant and stressed vowel:
    swerve → suêve
    sweat → suèt
    suave → suáve
    swarm → suaûm
    quake → quâke
    twerk → tuêke

b) After Q:
    to squeak → to squike
    to squeal → to squile
    squirmy → squêmy
    squid → squid

4. Silent U
U is silent when used to keep G hard before I, E, Y:
    to give → to guive
    to get → to guet
    gift → guift
    geek → guike
    guy 

SPECIAL NOTE
U cannot appear between M, N, R and another letter. Use O instead in these positions.

TEACHING NOTES
• Two consonants after U = /ə/
• U + single consonant + E = /u/
• U acts as /w/ in SU-, QU- patterns
• Silent U keeps G hard before soft vowels
