H

PRONUNCIATION
The letter H represents one sound:
• /h/ — as in "hope" (before vowels)

FUNCTIONS

1. Initial H = /h/
Before vowels at the start of words, H is pronounced /h/.

Examples:
    hope, hop, hat, hip, hot, hut, happy
    to hide → ta hîde
    to hit → ta hitte

2. Silent H as Buffer
H serves as a silent buffer between letters in various contexts.

Examples:
    sight → sîht
    tight → tyht
    to saw, sawing → ta sauhe, sauhing
    to cry, crying → ta crîe, crîhing

TEACHING NOTES
• Initial H before vowels = /h/
• H often silent in other positions
• H prevents awkward letter combinations (like -îi- becoming -îhi-)
