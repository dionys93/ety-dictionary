T

PRONUNCIATION
The letter T represents two sounds:
• /t/ — word-initial and word-final
• /ɾ/ — medial (between vowels)

RULES

1. T = /t/ (Initial and Final)
At the beginning and end of words, T is pronounced /t/.

Examples:
    true, tent, tan, tap, tackle, trample, trap, train, tune
    to take → ta tâke
    truth → treuþ
    trust → trost

2. T = /ɾ/ (Medial)
Between vowels, T is pronounced as a flap /ɾ/.

Examples:
    rattle, battle
    title → tîtle
    to flatter → ta flatre
    to matter → ta matre
    to batter → ta batre

TEACHING NOTES
• Initial/final T = /t/
• Intervocalic T = /ɾ/ (flap)
