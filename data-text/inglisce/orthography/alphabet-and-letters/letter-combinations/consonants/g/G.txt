G

PRONUNCIATION
The letter G represents two sounds:
• /g/ — before A, O, U (and before I, E with silent U)
• /d͡ʒ/ — before I, E, Y

RULES

1. G + A/O/U = /g/
Before A, O, and U, G is pronounced /g/.

Examples:
    gap, gain, guys
    game → gâme
    goat
    to go → ta goɯe
    gut, gun

2. G + I/E/Y = /d͡ʒ/
Before I, E, and Y, G is pronounced /d͡ʒ/.

Examples:
    gem, gin
    Georgia → Giorgia
    to pledge → ta plège
    gym → gim

3. Silent U Keeps G Hard
Silent U follows G before I and E when G remains /g/.

Examples:
    to get → ta guet
    to guess → ta guesse
    guild
    guilt

4. Silent H in Adjectives
Silent H follows G before Y in adjectives when G is /g/.

Examples:
    to fog → ta fogue
    foggy → foghy

TEACHING NOTES
