T

PRONUNCIATION
The letter T represents two sounds:
• /t/ — word-initial and word-final
• /ɾ/ — medial (between vowels)

RULES

1. T = /t/ (Initial and Final)
At the beginning and end of words, T is pronounced /t/.

Examples:

    tan, trample, tune
    tap -> tape
    trap -> trape
    train -> treine
    tackle -> tacle
    true -> treu
    tent -> tente
    to take → to tâcue
    truth → treuþ
    trust → treust

2. T = /ɾ/ (Medial)
Between vowels, T is pronounced as a flap /ɾ/.

Examples:
    rattle, battle
    title → tîtle
    to flatter → ta flatre
    to matter → ta matre
    to batter → ta batre

TEACHING NOTES
• Initial/final T = /t/
• Intervocalic T = /ɾ/ (flap)


ţ

PRONUNCIATION
The letter ȶ represents one sound:
• /t͡ʃ/ — as in "nature"

EXAMPLES
    feature → fieţure
    mature → maţûre
    pasture → pasţure
    stature → staţure
    nature → nâţure
    natural → naţural

VARIATION
Sometimes /t͡ʃ/ is represented with TI:
    creature → crietior
    amateur → amatior
    question

TEACHING NOTES
ţ = /t͡ʃ/. Replaces -ture endings.



Ћ þ (Thorn)

Ћ is the capitalized letter.
þ is the lowercase.

PRONUNCIATION
The letter þ represents two sounds:
• /ð/ — voiced (between vowels, in function words)
• /θ/ — voiceless (elsewhere)

RULES

1. þ = /ð/ (Voiced)
In function words and typically between vowels.

Function words:
    the → þe
    this → þis
    these → þise
    that → þat
    those → þose
    they → þey
    them → þem
    their → þeir
    there → þere

Between vowels:
    breathe → briþe
    bathe → bâþe
    clothe → cloþe

2. Þ = /θ/ (Voiceless)
In content words and non-intervocalic positions.

Examples:
    breath → breþ
    bath → baþ
    cloth → clòþ
    theory → þirie
    monotheism → monoþýism

Greek-derived words:
    chthonic → þónic
    chthonian → þonian

TEACHING NOTES
• Function words usually have voiced /ð/
• Content words usually have voiceless /θ/
• Between vowels tends toward /ð/
