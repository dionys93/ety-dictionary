S̃

PRONUNCIATION
The letter S̃ represents two sounds:
• /ʃ/ — before vowels and between consonant and vowel
• /ʒ/ — between vowels

RULES

1. S̃ = /ʃ/ (Before Vowels or After Consonants)
When S̃ appears before a vowel or between a consonant and vowel, it's pronounced /ʃ/.

Examples:
    sure → s̃ure
    to ensure → to ens̃ure
    to assure → to ass̃ure

2. S̃ = /ʒ/ (Between Vowels)
When S̃ appears between two vowels, it's pronounced /ʒ/.

Examples:
    vision → vis̃on
    visual → vis̃ual
    nausea → naus̃a
    pleasure → ples̃ure
    measure → mes̃ure
    treasure → tres̃ure

Note: Words like explosion → explôsion use regular S (not S̃) because two accents cannot appear near each other.

TEACHING NOTES
• Initial S̃ or after consonant = /ʃ/
• Intervocalic S̃ = /ʒ/
• Position determines pronunciation
