Ș

PRONUNCIATION
The letter Ș represents one sound:
• /ʃ/ — before vowels (not common) and at the end of words
• /ʒ/ — between vowels

RULES

1. Ș as /ʃ/ 
When Ș appears before a vowel or at the end of a word, it's pronounced /ʃ/.

Examples:
    shut → șote 
    finish → finișe
    banish → banișe

2. Ș as /ʒ/ 
When Ș appears between two vowels, it's pronounced /ʒ/.

Examples:
    visual → vișual
    pleasure → pleșure
    measure → meșure
    treasure → treșure


TEACHING NOTES
• Initial Ș or at the end = /ʃ/
• Intervocalic Ș = /ʒ/
• Position determines pronunciation
