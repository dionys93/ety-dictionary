ʃ (Long-S)

PRONUNCIATION
The letter ʃ represents one sound:
• /s/ — as in "gracious"

USAGE
Long-S is primarily used in adjectives, especially those ending in -oʃ (Modern English -ous).

EXAMPLES
    glorious → glorioʃ
    gracious → grâcioʃ
    facetious → facícioʃ
    atrocious → atrôcioʃ

TEACHING NOTES
ʃ = /s/. Replaces -ous endings with -oʃ in adjectives.
