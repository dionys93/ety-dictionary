SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN INGLISCE

OVERVIEW
Inglisce uses several special characters beyond the standard Latin alphabet to represent specific sounds more accurately. 
These characters are borrowed from various sources to create a more phonetic writing system.

THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS

Why needed: Allows consistent use of U for vowel sounds while having a distinct symbol for the consonant /w/

2. Ћ/þ (THORN)
Sound: /ð/ (voiced) or /θ/ (voiceless)
Origin: Old English and Icelandic
Purpose: Replaces TH digraph

Usage:
- Ћ = capital letter
- þ = lowercase letter
- Voiced /ð/: the → þe, they → þey
- Voiceless /θ/: think → þincue, bath → baþ
- Ћ/þ replaces Modern English "th"


TYPING CONSIDERATIONS

These special characters can be typed using:
1. Unicode input methods
2. Specialized keyboard layouts
3. Character substitution software
4. Copy-paste from character maps

TEACHING NOTES

1. Historical Connection
   - Ћ/þ connects to English's Anglo-Saxon roots

2. Phonetic Clarity
   - Each special character represents exactly one sound
   - Eliminates spelling ambiguities
   - Makes pronunciation predictable

3. Visual Distinction
   - Special characters signal special pronunciations
   - Helps readers immediately identify sound changes
   - Creates cleaner, more consistent text

The special characters work together with diacritical marks to create a writing system that is both more phonetic and more visually informative than traditional English orthography.
