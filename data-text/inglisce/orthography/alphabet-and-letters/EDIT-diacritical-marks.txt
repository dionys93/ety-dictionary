DIACRITICAL MARKS IN INGLISCE

OVERVIEW
Inglisce uses five diacritical marks to indicate pronunciation and stress patterns. These marks help create a more phonetic and consistent orthography.

THE FIVE MARKS

1. GRAVE ACCENT ( ̀ )
Purpose: Marks stressed open/lax vowels
Usage:
    À = stressed /æ/ 
    È = stressed /ɛ/ 
    Ò = stressed /ɔ/ 
    Ỳ = stressed /ɪ/ 

Examples:
    analysis → anàlysis
    anemone → anèmonie
    cost → còste

2. ACUTE ACCENT ( ́ )
Purpose: Marks stressed close/tense vowels and special pronunciations
Usage:
    Á = stressed /ɑ/
    ÉI = stressed /eɪ/
    Í = stressed /i/
    Ó = stressed /ɑ/
    Ú = stressed /ju/
    Ý = stressed /i/ 

Examples:
    father → fáþor 
    conveyance → convéiance 
    media → mídia 

3. CIRCUMFLEX ( ̂ )
Purpose: Marks special vowel qualities, often diphthongs or R-colored vowels
Usage:
    Â = /eɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ê = stressed /ər/
    Î = /aɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ô = stressed /oʊ/; /æʊ/ before -n, -m; /ʊ/ before -c
    Û = stressed /ʊ/

Examples:
    create → criâte (stressed /eɪ/)
    concern → concêne (stressed /ər/)
    find → fînd (/aɪ/)
    cushion → cûcion (stressed /ʊ/)

4. TILDE ( ̃ )
Purpose: Indicates palatalization (addition of /j/ sound)
Usage on consonants:
    M̃ = /mj/
    Ñ = /ɲ/

Examples:
    music → m̃usic (/mj/)

5. CEDILLA ( ̧ )
Purpose: Modifies consonant pronunciation
Usage:
    Ç = /s/ before a, o, u; /ʃ/ before i, e
    Ḑ = /d͡ʒ/
    Ș = /ʃ/
    Ţ = /t͡ʃ/; /ʃ/

Examples:
    publicity → publiçatie (/s/ before A)
    to appreciate → ta apríçiait (/ʃ/ before I)
    procedure → procíḑure (/d͡ʒ/)
    education → eḑucâcion (/d͡ʒ/)
    individual → indiviḑual (/d͡ʒ/)
    nature → nâţure (/t͡ʃ/)
    feature → fieţure (/t͡ʃ/)
    creature → crieţure (/t͡ʃ/)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

1. Stress Marking
   - Diacritical marks primarily indicate stressed syllables
   - Unmarked vowels are typically unstressed
   - In compound words, diacritical marks may appear without stress

2. One Mark Per Syllable
   - Avoid placing diacritical marks on adjacent syllables
   - This prevents visual clutter (e.g., explôsion not explôs̃on)

3. Priority System
   - Stress marking takes precedence over quality marking
   - When both stress and special quality need marking, use the appropriate diacritical

4. Conservation
   - Use diacritical marks only when necessary for clarity
   - Regular spelling patterns don't need marks

TEACHING NOTES
- Grave = open/lax vowels (mouth more open)
- Acute = close/tense vowels (mouth more closed) 
- Circumflex = complex vowels (diphthongs, R-colored)
- Tilde = palatalization (adding Y-sound)
- Cedilla = consonant modification (softening C, affricating D/T)

The system creates visual consistency: related sounds use related marks, making patterns easier to learn and remember.
