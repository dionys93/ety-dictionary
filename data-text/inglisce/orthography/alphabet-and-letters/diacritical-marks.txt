DIACRITICAL MARKS IN INGLISCE

OVERVIEW
Inglisce uses five diacritical marks to indicate pronunciation and stress patterns. These marks help create a more phonetic and consistent orthography.

THE FIVE MARKS

1. GRAVE ACCENT ( ̀ )
Purpose: Marks stressed open/lax vowels
Usage:
    À = stressed /æ/ 
    È = stressed /ɛ/ 
    Ò = stressed /ɔ/ 
    Ỳ = stressed /ɪ/ 

Examples:
    analysis → anàlysis
    anemone → anèmonie
    cost → còste
    analytical → analỳtical

2. ACUTE ACCENT ( ́ )
Purpose: Marks stressed close/tense vowels and special pronunciations
Usage:
    Á = stressed /ɑ/
    ÉI = stressed /eɪ/
    Í = stressed /i/
    Ó = stressed /ɑ/
    Ú = stressed /ju/
    Ý = stressed /i/ 

Examples:
    father → fáþor 
    conveyance → convéiance 
    media → mídia 
    contract → cóntract
    unicorn → únicorn
    feet → fýt

3. CIRCUMFLEX ( ̂ )
Purpose: Marks special vowel qualities, often diphthongs or R-colored vowels
Usage:
    Â = /eɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ê = stressed /ər/
    Î = /aɪ/ (usually stressed)
    Ô = stressed /oʊ/; /æʊ/ before -n, -m; /ʊ/ before -c
    Û = stressed /ʊ/

Examples:
    create → criâte (stressed /eɪ/)
    concern → concêne (stressed /ər/)
    find → fînd (/aɪ/)
    explosion  → explôsion (/oʊ/)
    explosive → explôssif (/oʊ/)
    round → rônd (/æʊ/)
    sound → sônd (/æʊ/)
    cook → côc (/ʊ/)
    cushion → cûcion (stressed /ʊ/)

4. TILDE ( ̃ )
Purpose: Indicates palatalization (addition of /j/ sound)
Usage on consonants:
    M̃ = /mʲ/
    Ñ = /nʲ/

Examples:
    museum → m̃usíom (/mʲ/)
    convenient → conviñent

5. CEDILLA/BOTTOM COMMA ( ̧ )
Purpose: Modifies consonant pronunciation
Usage:
    Ç = /s/ before a, o, u; /ʃ/ before i, e
    Ḑ = /d͡ʒ/
    Ș = /ʃ/
    Ț = /t͡ʃ/; /ʃ/

Examples:

    Ç as /s/
    juicer → juçor
    publicity → publiçatie
    
    Ç as /ʃ/
    publish → publiçe
    to appreciate → ta apríçiait

    Ḑ /d͡ʒ/
    procedure → procíḑure 
    education → eḑucâcion
    individual → indiviḑual

    Ș as /ʃ/
    banish → banișe
    finish → finișe
    tarnish → tarnișe

    Ț as /t͡ʃ/
    nature → nâţure 
    nurture → nourţure 
    feature → fieţure 
    fortune → forţon
    fixture → fixţure
    mixture → mixţure
    creature → crieţure

    Ț as /ʃ/
    capture → capţure
    picture → picţure
    Egyptian → igipţan

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

1. Stress Marking
   - Grave and acute marks indicate stressed syllables
   - In compound words, circumflexes may appear without stress

2. One Mark Per Word

3. Conservation
   - Use diacritical marks use only when necessary for clarity
   - Regular spelling patterns don't need marks

TEACHING NOTES
- Grave and Acute = represent stress and vowel quality
- Circumflex = represent quality, but usually also stress
- Tilde = palatalization
- Cedilla = consonant modification (softening C/S, affricating D/T)

The system creates visual consistency: related sounds use related marks, making patterns easier to learn and remember.
