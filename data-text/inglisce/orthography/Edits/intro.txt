Nouns and Verbs in Inglisce: Nouns with Silent E

In Inglisce, single-syllable nouns end with a silent -e in the singular noun form and verb forms.

The -e at the end of singular nouns is kept to facilitate noun-verb contractions. 
For example: My nâme's Tim. This allows for smooth contraction with verbs like "is" without altering the word's form.

Additional Notes

    Silent -e Retention in Verbs:
        Verbs always retain the silent -e in their base form, third person singular present tense, and past tense.
        The silent -e is dropped only when forming the present participle (-ing form).

    Silent -e Dropping in Nouns:
        Nouns drop the silent -e when forming the plural to maintain a consistent pluralization pattern.

    Pronunciation:
        The silent -e at the end of these words is not pronounced but affects the pronunciation of the preceding consonant and vowel.
