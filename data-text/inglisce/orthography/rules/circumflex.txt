The Circumflex Accent in Inglisce

In Inglish, the circumflex accent is used on the following vowels: â, î, ê, ô, û. 
It indicates both the pronunciation of the vowel and typically marks the stressed syllable in a word.

The primary IPA pronunciations for each vowel with a circumflex are:

    Ââ: /eɪ/
    Îî: /aɪ/
    Êê: /ər/
    Ôô: /oʊ/
    Ûû: /ʊ/

Examples:

    burn → bêne
    confirm → confême
    cushion → cûcion
    decide → decîde
    earn → êne
    hypnosis → hipnôsis
    location → locâcion


The vowels î, ê, ô, û can have secondary pronunciations when combined with certain vowels or consonants:

    aî: /ɛ/
    ô: /æʊ/ before -n and -m, /ʊ/ before -c
    oû: /ʊ/
    aû: /æʊ/

These secondary pronunciations typically occur before the consonants m and n.

    compare, comparison, comparable → compaire, compaîrasson, compaîrable
    impair, impairment → empeire, empeirement
    iron → îarn
    wear, wearable → ueire, ueirable
    would, could, should → oûd, coûd, seûd
