CEDILLA IN INGLISCE

Inglisce uses cedillas to represent specific sounds more consistently than traditional English spelling.
The letters c, d, s, and t are the only letters on which a cedilla may be added. "Comma below" may be used instead of cedilla, if it's easier to see on the font.

SUMMARY

These cedillas serve to:
    1. Preserve etymological relationships between word families
    2. Indicate pronunciation shifts that occur in English derivation
    3. Reduce spelling ambiguity by marking specific sounds consistently

The system maintains morphological connections between base forms (juce, spâce, slîce, acte) and their derived forms while indicating the sound changes 
that naturally occur.
