The Replacement of U with O in Inglisce

In Inglisce, the letter u is replaced by o in specific contexts, particularly when it occurs between r, t, m, n, and y. 
This change is inspired by Old French orthographic practices, where words like Munday were transformed into Monday to simplify spelling and improve readability. 
By adopting this shift, Inglish simplifies the visual complexity of words and maintains both phonetic and orthographic consistency.

Rules for Replacing U with O:

    The letter u is replaced with o when it occurs between the following letters:
