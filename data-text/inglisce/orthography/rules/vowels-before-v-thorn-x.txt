V, Ћ, and X in Inglish

In Inglish, single vowels are typically short when they occur before V, Ћ, or X, unless otherwise specified.

Examples (Modern English to Inglish):

    civil, sleave → civil, slíve  
    save, savvy → sâve, savy  
    myth, beneath → miþ, benieþ*

*Note: -ie- is used before -þ rather than -í-
