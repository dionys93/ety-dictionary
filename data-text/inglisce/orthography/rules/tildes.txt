Tildes in Inglish

The tilde is used on the following letters: b̃, c̃, g̃, h̃, m̃, ñ, p̃, s̃, x̃, z̃.

The tilde represents a yod sound /j/ following the letter. This often indicates that word stress occurs before the letter with the tilde, but in some cases, the stress comes after.
Examples (Modern English to Inglish):

    continue → contiñue (stress on the 'i' before the ñ)
    communicate → com̃uniqete (stress on the 'u' after the m̃)
