## The Replacement of ⟨u⟩ with ⟨o⟩ in Inglisce

### Scope

In certain lexical environments, Inglisce replaces ⟨u⟩ with ⟨o⟩ to reflect vowel backing and reduction in Modern English.  
This replacement is lexical and environment-sensitive, not phonemic and not fully productive.

This mechanism applies primarily to Germanic vocabulary and does not extend to learned Romance forms unless historically reinforced.

### Conditioning Environments

⟨u⟩ may surface as ⟨o⟩ in the following contexts:

- Adjacent to nasal consonants (⟨n, m⟩)
- Adjacent to labial consonants (⟨p, b⟩)
- In closed syllables with reduced or centralized vowels
- In unstressed or semi-stressed syllables of polysyllabic words

This replacement reflects backing and rounding tendencies rather than a distinct vowel class.

### Monosyllabic Nouns

| Modern English | Inglisce |
|---------------|----------|

| sum, sums | somme, soms |
| run, runs | rone, rons |
| none | non |
| nun, nuns | nonne, nons |
| son, sons | sone, sons |

### Verbs and Verbal Bases

| Modern English | Inglisce |
|---------------|----------|
| to come | to come |
| to stun | to stonne |
| stunt | stonte |
| to plunge | to plonge |
| to lunge | to longe |

Verbal forms preserve final ⟨-e⟩ structurally, even where vowel quality is reduced.

### Nasal + Stop Clusters

#### -nk Sets

| Modern English | Inglisce |
|---------------|----------|
| chunk | chonc(ue |
| bunk | bonc(ue |
| funk | fonc |
| gunk | gonc |

#### -mp Sets (Noun–Verb Alignment)

| Modern English | Inglisce |
|---------------|----------|
| bump | bompe, bomps |
| hump | hompe, homps |
| lump | lompe, lomps |
| jump | jompe, jomps |
| plump | plompe |

Verbal derivatives align orthographically with the noun base:

- to bompe → bompes, bomped, bomping  
- to hompe → hompes, homped, homping  
- to lompe → lompes, lomped, lomping  
- to jompe → jompes, jomped, jomping

### Polysyllabic Forms

| Modern English | Inglisce |
|---------------|----------|
| plummet (n) | plomet |
| plummet (v) | to plomete |
| summit | somet |

In polysyllabic words, ⟨o⟩ commonly reflects unstressed vowel reduction rather than full vowel contrast.

### Notes and Limitations

- This replacement does not constitute a general ⟨u → o⟩ rule.
- It does not apply to learned Romance vocabulary.
- It is distinct from ⟨eu⟩, which marks reduced central vowels in closed Germanic roots under different constraints.
- Forms are lexically restricted and should not be extended analogically.
