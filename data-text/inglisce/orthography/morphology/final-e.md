## Final ⟨-e⟩ in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, many **monosyllabic noun–verb bases** end in a **non-pronounced final ⟨-e⟩**.

This ⟨-e⟩ is **structural, not phonetic**.  
It stabilizes morphology, preserves vowel identity across inflection, and supports syntactic operations such as **noun–verb contraction**.

Final ⟨-e⟩ is therefore **retained by design**, even when silent.

---

### Core Functions of Final ⟨-e⟩

Final ⟨-e⟩ serves three closely related purposes:

1. **Base-form stability**  
   Many lexemes function as both nouns and verbs without orthographic change.

2. **Inflectional contrast**  
   The presence or absence of ⟨-e⟩ distinguishes singular, plural, and verbal forms in a predictable way.

3. **Contraction support**  
   Retaining ⟨-e⟩ preserves the full singular base under contraction.

Example:

> *My nâme’s Tim.*

Here, ⟨-e⟩ maintains contrast between:
- singular noun: **nâme**
- plural noun: **nâms**
- verbal forms: **nâmes, nâmed**

---

### Distribution

Final ⟨-e⟩ occurs primarily in:

- Monosyllabic noun–verb bases  
- Forms with long or diphthongal vowels  
- Lexemes where vowel quality must remain visible under inflection

The ⟨-e⟩ is **not pronounced**, but constrains how the preceding vowel is interpreted.

## Inflectional Behavior

### Verbs

Verbs **retain final ⟨-e⟩** in all finite forms except the present participle.

**Rules:**

- Infinitive: base form  
- 3rd person singular present: add **-s**  
- Past tense: add **-d**  
- Present participle: drop ⟨-e⟩ + add **-ing**

**Example: nâme**

| Form | Result |
|-----|--------|
| Infinitive | to nâme |
| 3sg present | nâmes |
| Past | nâmed |
| Present participle | nâming |

---

### Nouns

Nouns **drop final ⟨-e⟩** when forming the plural.

**Rules:**

- Singular: base form  
- Plural: drop ⟨-e⟩ + add **-s**

If dropping ⟨-e⟩ would obscure vowel quality, an **accent** is introduced.

**Example: site**

| Form | Result |
|-----|--------|
| Singular | site |
| Plural | síts |

(See [Acute Accent](../diacritics/acute.md).)

## Representative Examples

### Shared Noun–Verb Bases

- nâme → nâms / to nâme  
- tîme → tîms / to tîme  
- fême → fêms / to fême  
- core → cors / to core  
- store → stors / to store  

### Vowel-Preserving Forms

- site → síts  
- lîfe → lîfs  
- uîfe → uîfs  

### Additional Forms

- bâle → bâls  
- scâle → scâls  
- mâle → mâls  
- reute → reuts  
- baure → baurs  
- guare → guars

## Interaction with Diacritics

Final ⟨-e⟩ interacts with diacritics in systematic ways:

- Accents are added **only when vowel quality would otherwise be ambiguous**
- Diacritics **supplement** ⟨-e⟩; they do not replace it
- The presence of ⟨-e⟩ reduces the need for accent marking

This maintains **orthographic economy**.

---

### Design Principle

Final ⟨-e⟩ in Inglisce is not a historical remnant.

It is a **functional marker of lexemic completeness** that:

- aligns noun and verb morphology  
- preserves vowel identity across inflection  
- maintains clear singular–plural contrast  
- avoids exceptional spellings  

⟨-e⟩ thus functions as **structural punctuation of the lexeme**, not as a phonetic signal.
