## Plurals of Learned Romance Nouns in **-re**

A small class of inherited and learned nouns ending in **-re** retain the final **-e** for **structural purposes**, e.g., to form contractions (*maþre + is = maþre's*).  
Their plurals replace **-re** with a vowel-bearing suffix, reflecting **historical stem forms**.

This pattern is **lexically restricted** and **non-productive**.
