## Derivational Patterns in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, certain **derivational stems** maintain their integrity across both **pluralization** and **adjectival or related forms**.  
This preserves morphological transparency and reduces orthographic ambiguity.

### Plural Patterns

Some endings follow regular derivational pluralization patterns derived from Latin/Romance roots:

| Singular Ending | Plural Ending | Examples |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| -cle / -gle      | -culs / -guls | cîcle, cîculs; ígle, íguls |
| -âble           | -âbuls        | câble, câbuls; tâble, tâbuls |
| -able            | -abils         | recîclable, recîclabils |

These patterns **regularize inherited Romance forms** while maintaining the root stem consistently.

### Derivation Beyond Plurals

Many of these stems also serve as the basis for **adjectival forms**, further reinforcing morphological stability:

| Base | Plural | Adjective |
|------|--------|-----------|
| ângle | ânguls | ângular |
| circle | circuls | circular |
| tâble | tâbuls | tabular |
| fâble | fâbuls | fabulus |

**Note:** The adjectival form preserves the stem in the same way the plural does, highlighting **reusability of the base across derivational processes**.

### Design Principles

1. **Stem Visibility** – Both plural and derived forms reflect the underlying root.  
2. **Morphological Transparency** – Readers can easily infer the base from any derived form.  
3. **Consistency** – Regularization across -cle, -âble, and -able families avoids ad hoc pluralizations or adjectival changes.

This approach ensures Inglisce maintains a **predictable relationship between nouns, plurals, and adjectives**, strengthening both orthographic clarity and derivational logic.
