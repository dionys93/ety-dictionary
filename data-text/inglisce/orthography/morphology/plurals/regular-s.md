## Regular **-s** Plurals

This file describes the **default plural formation** in Inglisce: adding **-s** to the singular base.

Regular **-s** plurals apply when the noun does **not** fall under a more specific phonological or morphological rule.

---

### Core Rule

> **Singular + -s → Plural**

The written **-s** plural is used broadly and consistently. Phonetic voicing (e.g. /s/ → /z/) occurs naturally in speech and is **not encoded orthographically** unless required by another rule.

---

### Final **-e** Bases

Most nouns surface with a final **-e** in the singular. This **-e is retained** in the singular but **dropped before plural -s**.

| Singular | Plural |
| -------- | ------ |
| nâme    | nâms  |
| site     | síts  |
| mape     | maps   |
| âpe     | âps   |
| songue   | sòngs |
| dogue    | dogs   |
| nonne    | nons   |
| starre   | stars  |

**Rationale:**

* Preserves a complete and stable base in isolation
* Maintains visual contrast with verbal and possessive forms

---

### Bases Ending in **-ie**

Nouns ending in **-ie** form plurals in **-is**.

| Singular    | Plural      |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| bâbie      | bâbis      |
| remedie     | remedis     |
| recipie     | recipis     |
| hypêrbolie | hypêrbolis |

---

### Sibilant and Affricate Bases

When the base already ends in a sibilant sound, **-s** or **-es** is added.

| Singular    | Plural      |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| câge      | câges      |
| frise | frises |
| chise | chises |
| finișe | finișes |
| fisce | fisces |
| busce | busces |
| church | churches |
| vâss | vâsses |
| bâss | bâsses |

---

## Regular **-ve → -ves**

Nouns ending in **-ve** retain **-v-** in both singular and plural.

| Singular | Plural |
| -------- | ------ |
| câve    | câves |
| fâve    | fâves |

The written form remains stable; phonetic voicing is automatic.

## Scope of This Rule

This file covers **default pluralization** only.

The following are handled in dedicated files:

* **-re** plurals (origin-based: -ors, -ars, -irs)
* **Velar alternations** (-c → -x, -ix, -aix, etc.)
* **Latinate and learned plurals** (-sis → -sies, etc.)
* **Consonant-cluster reductions** (-cte → -cs, -pte → -ps)

When multiple rules could apply, **the more specific rule overrides regular -s**.

---

## Summary

* **-s** is the default plural marker
* Final **-e** is dropped before **-s**
* **-es** is used after sibilants
* Voicing is phonetic, not orthographic

This regularity provides a stable baseline against which more complex plural systems operate.
