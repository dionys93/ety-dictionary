## Pluralization of ⟨-fe⟩ Nouns

### Overview

Inglisce **eliminates the -f → -ves alternation** found in Modern English.

Nouns ending in ⟨-fe⟩ form their plural **regularly with -fs**, preserving the written ⟨f⟩ in all forms.

This removes a morphologically irregular pattern while retaining natural pronunciation.

### Core Rule

- **Singular:** base form  
- **Plural:** drop **-e** add **-s**  
- No consonant mutation occurs in orthography.

Although written ⟨-fs⟩, the cluster is **naturally voiced** in speech as /vz/ where phonotactically expected.

### Examples

| Modern English | Inglisce Singular | Inglisce Plural |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| leaf / leaves | liefe | liefs |
| wife / wives | uîfe | uîfs |
| knife / knives | nîfe | nîfs |
| wolf / wolves | uôlfe | uôlfs |
| hoof / hooves | hôfe | hôfs |
| calf / calves | càfe | càfs |
| loaf / loaves | lofe | loafs |

The written form remains stable while pronunciation follows general voicing rules.

### Words Without Voicing

Some ⟨-fe⟩ nouns **do not undergo voicing** in speech and remain /fs/.

These behave identically in spelling.

Examples:

- beliefe → beliefs  
- chiefe → chiefs  
- proufe → proufs  

No distinction is required in orthography.

### Design Rationale

This treatment:

- Removes an irregular plural class  
- Preserves a single visible base across inflection  
- Aligns with Inglisce’s principle of **morphological transparency**
- Allows phonology to resolve voicing without spelling alternation

Plural formation therefore remains **fully regular**, with no loss of phonetic clarity.
