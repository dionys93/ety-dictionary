## Pluralization of ⟨-fe⟩ Nouns

### Overview

Inglisce **eliminates the ⟨-f → -ves⟩ alternation** found in Modern English.

Nouns ending in ⟨-fe⟩ form their plural **regularly with ⟨-fs⟩**, preserving the written ⟨f⟩ in all forms.

This removes a morphologically irregular plural class while maintaining natural pronunciation.

---

### Core Rule

- **Singular:** base form  
- **Plural:** drop final ⟨-e⟩, add ⟨-s⟩  
- No consonant mutation occurs in orthography

Although written ⟨-fs⟩, the cluster is **regularly voiced in speech** as /vz/ where phonotactically expected.

(See **stem-voicing.md**.)

### Examples

| Modern English | Inglisce Singular | Inglisce Plural |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| leaf / leaves | liefe | liefs |
| wife / wives | uîfe | uîfs |
| knife / knives | nîfe | nîfs |
| wolf / wolves | uôlfe | uôlfs |
| hoof / hooves | hôfe | hôfs |
| calf / calves | càfe | càfs |
| loaf / loaves | lofe | loafs |

The written stem remains unchanged across number.

### Words Without Voicing

Some ⟨-fe⟩ nouns **do not voice** the cluster in speech and remain /fs/.

These behave identically in spelling.

Examples:

- beliefe → beliefs  
- chiefe → chiefs  
- proufe → proufs  

No distinction is required in orthography.

### Design Rationale

This treatment:

- Removes an irregular plural class  
- Preserves a single visible base across inflection  
- Aligns with Inglisce principles of **morphological transparency**  
- Allows phonology to resolve voicing without spelling alternation

Plural formation is therefore **fully regular**.
