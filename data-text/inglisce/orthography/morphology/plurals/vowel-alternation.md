## Vowel Alternation in Plural Formation

### Overview

A small number of Inglisce nouns form plurals with a **visible change to the stem vowel**.

These alternations are **lexical, historical, and non-productive**.  
They are preserved only where they are already established and contrastive.

No general vowel-change rule is implied.

### Vowel Alternation with ⟨-x⟩ Plurals

In several closed lexical sets, nouns ending in ⟨-c⟩ form plurals in ⟨-x⟩.
In these cases, the plural also reflects a **graphic vowel alternation**.

#### **-ic → -ix**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| stic | stix |
| lic | lix |
| pic | pix |
| uic | uix |

### Morphological Contrast

Some surface-identical singular forms belong to **different morphological bases** and therefore pluralize differently.

| Singular | Plural | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| pic | pix | lexical noun (“pick as in pickaxe”) |
| pic(țure) | pics | truncated Inglisce base (*picțure*) |

In these cases, vowel alternation applies only to the **monomorphemic lexical stem**.
Derived or truncated forms pluralize regularly with ⟨-s⟩.

#### **-iec → -iex**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| biec | biex |
| chiec | chiex |
| liec | liex |
| friec | friex

---

#### **-auc → -aux**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| chauc | chaux |
| stauc | staux |
| tauc | taux |
| ouac | ouax |

---

#### **-âc → -aix**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| brâc | braix |
| câc | caix |
| râc | raix |
| stâc | staix |
| faic | faix |

Some nouns do not alternate and retain regular ⟨-s⟩:

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| lâc | lâcs |

#### **-eic → -eix**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| breic | breix |
| steic | steix |

---

#### **-ôc → -eox**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| bôc | beox |
| côc | queox |
| hôc | heox |
| lôc | leox |

---

#### **-oque → -oax**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| joque | joax |
| cloque | cloax |
| stroque | stroax |
| bloac | bloax |
| spoac | spoax |

#### **-oc → -ox**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| stoc | stox |
| loc | lox |
| coc | cox |

---

#### **-erc → -êx**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| uerc | uêx |

#### **-ique → -ícs**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| pique | pícs |
| lique | lícs |

---

#### **-uque → -ucs/-úcs**

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| duque | ducs |

### Lexical Vowel Alternation Without ⟨-s⟩

A small number of high-frequency nouns preserve inherited plural forms with **internal vowel alternation** and non-⟨-s⟩ suffixes.

These are lexical survivals and do not form a productive pattern.

| Singular | Plural |
|--------|--------|
| man | men |
| uôman | uimmen |
| ox | oxen |
| chîld | children |

---

### Scope and Limits

- Vowel alternation is **not a general plural strategy**
- It occurs only in **closed lexical sets**
- No new forms are created by analogy
- Predictable phonetic variation is not represented

---

### Orthographic Principle

Inglisce preserves vowel alternation **only where it is lexically established** and already part of the plural form.
