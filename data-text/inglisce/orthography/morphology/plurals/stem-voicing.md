## Stem Voicing Before Plural ⟨-s⟩

### Overview

Inglisce does **not alter spelling to mark voicing** triggered by plural ⟨-s⟩.

As in spoken Modern English, the plural suffix ⟨-s⟩ is realized phonetically as **/s/ or /z/** depending on its phonological environment.
This behavior is **phonetic, not morphological**, and is not represented in orthography.

---

### Voicing of Plural ⟨-s⟩

The plural suffix ⟨-s⟩ is pronounced:

- **/s/** after voiceless segments  
- **/z/** after voiced segments and vowels  

This reflects ordinary Modern English phonology and applies uniformly across Inglisce plural classes.

No spelling distinction is made.

---

### Effect on Stem Consonants

When plural ⟨-s⟩ is realized as /z/, preceding consonants may be **phonetically voiced** in connected speech.

A common case is ⟨f⟩:

- written ⟨-fs⟩ may be pronounced /vz/

This voicing is:
- predictable
- non-contrastive
- resolved entirely in pronunciation

No consonant alternation is marked in spelling.

---

### Scope

This behavior applies to:

- regular ⟨-s⟩ plurals  
- ⟨-fe⟩ plurals (see *f-pluralization.md*)  
- all plural formations ending in ⟨-s⟩

Lexical exceptions exist, as in Modern English, but require no orthographic distinction.

---

### Orthographic Principle

Inglisce preserves **morphological stability** and **base transparency**.

Phonetic voicing associated with plural ⟨-s⟩ follows spoken English and is not encoded in the written form.
