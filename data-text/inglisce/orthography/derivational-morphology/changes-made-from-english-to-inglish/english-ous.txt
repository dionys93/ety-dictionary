Modern English -ous from Latin -osus and Greek -οῦς

The suffix "-ous" plays a significant role in adjective formation in English. 
It has its origins in both Latin and Greek, carrying over through Old French into English. 
In Latin, the suffix "-osus" denotes "full of" or "abounding in," while in Greek, the suffix -οῦς has a similar meaning. 
This suffix is used to create adjectives that denote possessing, full of, or having the qualities of the root noun.

Inglish uses -oʃ wherever English would use -ous.
