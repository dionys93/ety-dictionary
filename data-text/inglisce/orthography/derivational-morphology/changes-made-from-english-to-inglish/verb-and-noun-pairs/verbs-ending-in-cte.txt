Nouns and Verbs in Inglish: -cte

In Inglish, verbs that end in -cte follow consistent patterns in both their verb conjugations and noun derivations.

Verbs retain the -cte ending for all pronouns in the present tense, except for the third-person singular, which drops -te and adds -s.

Examples:

    Infinitive and Present Tense: ta acte, acte
    Singular Third-Person Present: acs
    Past Tense: acted
    Continuous/Gerund: acting


Nouns derived from these verbs drop the -e in their singular form; for plurals, they drop the -t and add -s.

Examples:

    Singular: act
    Plural: acs


Many of these verbs have their origins in Latin, where nouns indicating an action or its result were often formed using the suffix -io (nominative singular) or -ionis (genitive singular). 
In Latin, these nouns were derived from the supine stem or perfect participle of the verb, which functioned as a verbal noun.

The supine stem was a specific form of the verb used in Latin to denote purpose or result, and when combined with -io, it created nouns that described actions or their outcomes (e.g., actio from agere). 
These nouns entered English through French, which used -tion (e.g., action), closely following the Latin -io form.

In Inglish, however, the adaptation of these verb forms takes a slightly different approach. 
Rather than using the -tion ending found in Modern English (influenced by French), Inglish adopts a Spanish-inspired interpretation, using the suffix -cion for the corresponding nouns. 
This reflects the way many Latin-based languages, including Spanish, have adapted these verb forms.

In Inglish, verbs ending in -cte change to -cion for noun forms, where the verb’s -t is replaced by -c, following this inherited Latin morphological structure.

Examples:

    Verb: ta acte
    Noun: accion(s)
