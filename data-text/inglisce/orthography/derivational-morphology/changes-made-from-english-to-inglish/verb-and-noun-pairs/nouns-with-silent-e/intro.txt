Nouns and Verbs in Inglish: Nouns with Silent E

In Inglish, single- and double-syllable nouns ending in -or, and consonants -f -k, -l, -m, -n, -r, -t end with a silent -e in the singular noun form and verb forms.

The -e at the end of singular nouns is kept to facilitate noun-verb contractions. 
For example: My nâme's Tim. This allows for smooth contraction with verbs like "is" without altering the word's form.

Some vowels take an acute accent in the plural form to maintain their long vowel pronunciation.

Additional Notes

    Silent -e Retention in Verbs:
        Verbs always retain the silent -e in their base form, third person singular present tense, and past tense.
        The silent -e is dropped only when forming the present participle (-ing form).

    Silent -e Dropping in Nouns:
        Nouns drop the silent -e when forming the plural to maintain a consistent pluralization pattern.

    Pronunciation:
        The silent -e at the end of these words is not pronounced but affects the pronunciation of the preceding consonant and vowel.
