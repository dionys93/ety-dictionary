Introduction to Distinguishing Nouns and Verbs in Inglisce

In Inglisce, words that function as both nouns and verbs are systematically distinguished through specific spelling conventions and conjugation rules. 
Predictable morphological changes reduce ambiguity and enhance clarity, enabling readers to identify a word's grammatical role within a sentence.

For example, the word nâme changes form based on its function:

    As a Verb (Conjugation):
        Present: ta nâme (to name)
        Third-person singular: nâmes (names)
        Past tense: nâmed (named)
        Present participle: nâming (naming)

    As a Noun (Declension):
        Singular: nâme
        Plural: nâms

These patterns apply to a wide range of verbs and nouns in Inglish, with some variations based on specific endings and vowel changes. 
The conjugation of verbs and the declension of nouns follow predictable paths, which are explored in detail on other pages.
