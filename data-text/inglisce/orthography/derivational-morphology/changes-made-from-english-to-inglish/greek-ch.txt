Modern English ch from Greek χ

In Modern English, the spelling "ch" is used to represent the Greek letter χ when transliterating Greek words. 
This convention stems from the way Greek words were adapted into Latin and subsequently into English. 
As a result, many English words of Greek origin feature "ch" where a "k" sound is pronounced.

In Inglish, in alignment with Modern Spanish, the letter combination "ch" only represents the sound /tʃ/.
In English words where "ch" was pronounced "k", Inglish uses either the letter "k" or "c" - simplifying the orthography.


Examples:
    Chaos: From Greek χάος
    Character: From Greek χαρακτήρ
    Chorus: Latin word from Greek χορός
    Choir: From Latin chorus, from Greek χορός
    Mechanic: From Greek μηχανικός
    Technical: From Greek τεχνικός
    Chthonic: From Greek χθόνιος

Inglish uses -k- or -c- instead:
    kâoʃ
    câractre (letters), câractor (person)
    korus
    cuîor
    mecanic
    teknical
    þónic (k is dropped, because it's not pronounced)
