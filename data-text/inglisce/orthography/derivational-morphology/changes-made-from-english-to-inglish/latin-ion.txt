Modern English -ion from Latin

The suffix "-ion" plays a significant role in noun formation in both Latin and French, carrying over into English and other languages that have borrowed from them. 
This suffix is used to create nouns that express the action, result, or condition related to the meaning of the root verb.

Inglish borrows these words from English and applies accent marks and letters typically derived from Romance languages.

E.g.

-cte becomes -ccion
to act -> ta acte
the action -> þi accion
to compact -> ta compacte
the compaction -> þa compaccion
to infect -> to infecte
the infection -> þi infeccion


-ete/-aite becomes -âcion
to animate -> ta animete
the animation -> þi animâcion

to negate -> ta negâte
