Modern English -ion from Latin

The suffix "-ion" plays a significant role in noun formation in both Latin and French, carrying over into English and other languages that have borrowed from them. 
This suffix is used to create nouns that express the action, result, or condition related to the meaning of the root verb.

Inglisce borrows these words from English and applies accent marks and letters typically derived from Romance languages.

E.g.

-cte becomes -ccion
to act -> to acte
the action -> þi accion
to compact -> to compacte
the compaction -> þa compaccion
to infect -> to infecte
the infection -> þi infeccion


-ete/-aite becomes -âcion
to animate -> to animait
the animation -> þi animâcion
to demonstrate -> to demonstrait
the demonstration -> þa demonstrâcion
to navigate -> to navegaite
the navigation -> þa navegâcion
to donate -> to donait
the donation -> þa donâcion

the dictation -> þa dictâcion
to operate -> to opperaite
the operation -> þi opperâcion


-âte becomes -âcion

to negate -> to negâte
the negation -> þa negâcion
to conflate -> to conflâte
the conflation -> þa conflâcion

These words drop their accents when forming adjectives
