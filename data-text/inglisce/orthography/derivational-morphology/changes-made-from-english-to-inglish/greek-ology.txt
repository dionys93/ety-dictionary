Modern English -ology from Greek -λογία

The suffix "-ology" is used in English to form nouns that refer to a field of study or a branch of knowledge. 
This suffix originates from the Greek word "-λογία" (-logia), which means "the study of" or "the science of."

Inglish uses "-ólogie" which better shows where the stress in the word is.

Examples:
    biology: The study of living organisms (from Greek "bios" meaning "life" + "logia").
    geology: The study of the Earth and its processes (from Greek "geo" meaning "earth" + "logia").
    psychology: The study of the mind and behavior (from Greek "psyche" meaning "mind" + "logia").

Inglish:
    bîólogie
    giólogie
    sykólogie
