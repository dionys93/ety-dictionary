Silent 'g' and 'gn' in Inglish: Etymology-Based Rules

Historical Background

The silent "g" in Modern English occurs in words where "g" is not pronounced, usually before "n" at the beginning or middle of a word. 
This spelling convention has historical roots in Old English and Latin. Originally, the "g" was pronounced, but over time, its pronunciation was dropped while the spelling was retained.

Inglish handles silent 'g' differently based on etymology:

1. Words of Old English origin: Silent 'g' is dropped
2. Words of French and Latin origin: Silent 'g' is often preserved, especially in patterns like -ign, -égn, and -aign
3. Some Latin-derived words: Inglish re-adds or keeps -g- that existed in the original Latin

Pronunciation Patterns

-ign is pronounced as /aɪn/ (like "sign")
-aign and -égn are pronounced as /eɪn/ (like "reign")
The -g- becomes pronounced when suffixes are added to -ign and -égn
