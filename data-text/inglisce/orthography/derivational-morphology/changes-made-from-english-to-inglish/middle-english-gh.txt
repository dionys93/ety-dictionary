Modern English gh from Middle English

The use of "-gh" in Modern English is largely historical, reflecting older pronunciations that have since evolved or disappeared in most dialects. 
Its appearance in words today is a result of the historical development of English spelling, which has preserved these letters as silent markers or indicators of vowel quality rather than as symbols of specific sounds to be pronounced.

In Inglish, these historical spellings are systematically reformed to better reflect modern pronunciation while maintaining etymological connections. 
Inglish generally keeps the "h" or replaces "gh" with "ff", but the "g" is dropped entirely in every case, creating more consistent spelling patterns.

Words with /aɪ/ sound:
   the sight -> þe sîht /saɪt/
   the sigh -> þe syh /saɪ/
   the fright -> þe fryht /fraɪt/
   the flight -> þe flyht /flaɪt/
   the fight -> þe fyht /faɪt/
   the knight -> þe nîht /naɪt/
   sleight -> slyht /slaɪt/
   slight -> slîht /slaɪt/
   the height -> þe hîht /haɪt/

Words with /eɪ/ sound:
   the weight -> þe ɯeht /weɪt/
   the freight -> þe freht /freɪt/

Special cases:
   the night -> þe náit /naɪt/ (Spelling influenced by Old English "næht")

In these words, the "h" serves both as a buffer between letters and as an etymological vestige. 
For words where -eight is pronounced /eɪt/, the "h" elongates the "e" while preserving a connection to the word's historical form.

Inglish simplifies these patterns by using -oht consistently for all verbs in this category, making the system more regular while preserving the connection between forms:

   to think, thought -> ta þinke, þoht
   to seek, sought -> ta sike, soht
