Modern English -fe to -ves

In Modern English, many nouns ending in -f or -fe change to -ves in the plural form, representing a shift from an unvoiced /f/ sound to a voiced /v/ sound. 

Inglish simplifies this pattern by maintaining the -f in written form for both singular and plural.
The -fs ending is naturally voiced to sound like /vz/ in speech. 

Examples:
   leaf, leaves -> liefe, liefs
   wife, wives -> ɯîfe, ɯîfs
   knife, knives -> nîfe, nîfs
   wolf, wolves -> ɯôlf, ɯôlfs
   hoof, hooves -> hûfe, hûfs
   calf, calves -> càfe, càfs
   loaf, loaves -> lofe, loafs
   
In some words the f remains unvoiced:
   belief -> beliefs (not "believes")
   chief -> chiefs (not "chieves")
   prouf -> proufs (not "prooves")
