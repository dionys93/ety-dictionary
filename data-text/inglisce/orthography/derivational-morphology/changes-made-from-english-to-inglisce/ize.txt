Modern English -ize from Old French -iser, Latin -izare, and Greek -ίζειν

The suffix "-ize" is used in English to form verbs that mean to make, cause to be, or subject to a process. 
It originates from the Greek "-ίζειν", was adopted into Latin as "-izare," 
and then into Old French as "-iser" before entering English as "-ize." 
This suffix is widely used in English to create verbs indicating transformation or action.

Inglisce takes inspiration from the Greek, and the Old French, and uses -yse.

    realize: From "real" (to make real or to become aware).
    organize: From "organ" (to arrange systematically).
