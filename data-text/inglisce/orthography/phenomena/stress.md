## Stress in Inglisce

### Overview

Stress in Inglisce is **predictable by word class and morphology**.  
It determines vowel pronunciation, guides accent usage, and, for nouns, signals gender.

### Default Stress by Word Class

| Word Class | Default Stress |
|------------|----------------|
| Nouns | **first syllable** |
| Adjectives | **first syllable** |
| Verbs | **last syllable** or **penultimate syllable**, depending on suffix |

**Note:** Default stress does **not** require an accent; non-default stress does.

### Gender and Stress

For nouns:

- **First-syllable stress** → masculine  
- **Other stress patterns** → feminine  

This provides a morpho-phonological cue to gender without altering the spelling.

### Non-Default Stress

Non-default stress occurs in:

- Borrowed words  
- Morphologically complex forms  
- Exceptions to standard stress patterns  

It is marked with the **acute accent (´)** to preserve stress clarity.

**Examples:**

| English | Inglisce | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| father | fáþre | First-syllable stress; accent optional if predictable |
| unusual | unúșual | Second-syllable stress; accent required |
| containment | contéinment | Stress on penultimate syllable due to suffix |

### Interaction with Morphology

- **Verbs:** Stress shifts depending on the suffix. Infinitive endings typically attract stress to the **last** or **penultimate** syllable.  
- **Nouns/Adjectives:** Stress remains on the **first syllable** unless overridden by derivation, borrowing, or non-default patterns.  

This system ensures the acute accent is used **only when stress is non-predictable**, keeping orthography simple and readable.
