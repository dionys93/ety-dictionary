## Stress in Inglisce

### Overview

Stress in Inglisce is **largely predictable by word class and morphology**.  
It determines vowel pronunciation, governs accent usage, and, for nouns, signals grammatical gender.

### Default Stress by Word Class

| Word Class | Default Stress |
|------------|----------------|
| Nouns | **first syllable** |
| Adjectives | **first syllable** |
| Verbs | **last syllable** or **penultimate syllable**, depending on suffix |

**Rule:** Default stress does **not** require an accent.  
Accents appear only when stress must be **explicitly signaled**.

### Gender and Stress (Nouns)

In Inglisce, stress assignment also encodes grammatical gender:

- **First-syllable stress** → **masculine**
- **Any other stress pattern** → **feminine**

This allows gender to be inferred phonologically without additional marking or agreement morphology.

### Non-Default Stress

Non-default stress arises in the following contexts:

- Borrowed words  
- Morphologically complex formations  
- Exceptions to regular stress patterns  

When stress cannot be inferred from default rules, it is marked with an accent.

- **Acute accent (´)** is used when stress itself must be made explicit.
- **Grave** and **circumflex** accents may also encode stress when required by vowel quality or gender.

### Examples

| English | Inglisce | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| father | **fáþre** | First-syllable stress; accent optional if fully predictable |
| unusual | **unúșual** | Second-syllable stress; accent required |
| containment | **contéinment** | Penultimate stress imposed by suffix |

---

### Interaction with Morphology

- **Verbs:** Stress is determined by verbal suffixes and typically falls on the **last** or **penultimate** syllable.
- **Nouns and adjectives:** Stress defaults to the **first syllable** unless overridden by borrowing, derivation, or irregular formation.

This system ensures that stress marking is **economical**: accents are used only when necessary for clarity.
