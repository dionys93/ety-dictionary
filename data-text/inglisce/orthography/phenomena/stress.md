## Stress in Inglisce

### Overview

Stress in Inglisce is **largely predictable by word class and morphology**, and is left unmarked whenever it can be inferred.  
It determines vowel pronunciation, governs accent usage, and, for nouns, signals grammatical gender.

### Default Stress by Word Class

| Word Class | Default Stress |
|------------|----------------|
| Nouns | **first syllable** |
| Adjectives | **first syllable** |
| Verbs | **last syllable** or **penultimate syllable**, as determined by verbal suffix |

**Rule:** Default stress does **not** require an accent.  
Accents appear only when stress must be **explicitly signaled**.

### Gender and Stress (Nouns)

In Inglisce, stress assignment also encodes grammatical gender:

- **First-syllable stress** → **masculine**
- **Any other stress pattern** → **feminine**

This allows gender to be inferred phonologically without additional marking or agreement morphology.

Accented first-syllable stress does **not** indicate feminine gender; only a shift away from initial stress does.

### Non-Default Stress

Non-default stress arises in the following contexts:

- Borrowed words  
- Morphologically complex formations  
- Exceptions to regular stress patterns  

When stress cannot be inferred from default rules, it is marked with an accent.
An accent is also required when vowel quality cannot be inferred, even if stress itself is predictable.

- **Grave and acute accents** always mark a **stressed vowel**.
- **Circumflex (`ˆ`)** primarily marks vowel quality and **also marks stress when required by grammatical gender**.

### Examples

| English | Inglisce | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| father | **fáþre** | First-syllable stress (default); acute required to specify /ɑ/|
| unusual | **unúșual** | Second-syllable stress; accent required |
| containment | **contéinment** | Penultimate stress imposed by suffix |

---

### Interaction with Morphology

- **Verbs:** Stress is determined by verbal suffixes and typically falls on the **last** or **penultimate** syllable.
- **Nouns and adjectives:** Stress defaults to the **first syllable** unless overridden by borrowing, derivation, or irregular formation.

When morphological structure predicts stress unambiguously, accents are prohibited.

This system ensures that stress marking is **economical**: accents are used only when necessary for clarity.
