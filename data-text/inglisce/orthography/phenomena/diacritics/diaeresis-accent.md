## The Diaeresis in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **diaeresis** is used on the letters **ü, ï, ÿ**.

Unlike the acute, grave, and circumflex accents, the diaeresis does **not primarily assign stress**.  
Its function is to **disambiguate glide formation and vowel relationships** that would otherwise be misread under default orthographic rules.

The diaeresis may co-occur with another accent in the same word.

### Function and Distribution

The diaeresis serves three closely related purposes:

1. To mark **ü** as the glide **/w/** in environments where ⟨u⟩ might otherwise be interpreted as a vowel.
2. To **separate i from following vowels**, preventing it from forming a long vowel or diphthong.
3. To clarify **stress-bearing high vowels** in forms where default stress assignment would obscure pronunciation.

### Phonetic Values

| Letter | IPA | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| ü | /w/ | Explicit glide |
| ï | /ɪ/ | Stressed short vowel before consonants |
| ï | /i/ | Vowel before another vowel |
| ÿ | /i/ | Stressed vowel derived from *ie + ing* |

---

### ü: Glide Clarification

The letter **ü** marks **/w/** explicitly when ⟨u⟩ appears after a vowel and could otherwise be misinterpreted as syllabic.

This preserves correct syllabification and prevents vowel fusion.

---

### ï: Vowel Separation and Shortening

The diaeresis on **ï** separates **i** from a following vowel, blocking the default interpretation of **i–e** as a long vowel or diphthong.

For example:

- **bide** → /bid/  
- **bïde** → /bɪd/

Here, **ï** breaks the i–e relationship, forcing a short vowel realization.

Additionally, **ï** represents **stressed /ɪ/** before consonants, most commonly in verb forms where vowel shortening must be made explicit.

---

### ÿ: Stress in *ie + ing* Forms

When **ie** combines with **-ing**, the sequence becomes **ying**.

In such cases:

- **ÿ** represents **stressed /i/**
- The diaeresis prevents ⟨y⟩ from being interpreted as a glide or reduced vowel

This makes stress explicit in derived forms where it would otherwise be unclear.

---

### Orthographic Contrast

- The diaeresis does **not** indicate vowel length or tone.
- It does **not introduce stress on its own**, but may **mark a stressed vowel** when stress is already required by morphology.
- Unlike other diacritics, the diaeresis may **co-occur with another accent** in the same word.
- See [Acute Accent](acute-accent.md), [Grave Accent](grave-accent.md), and [Circumflex Accent](circumflex.md) for stress- and quality-marking diacritics.
- See [Stress](stress.md) for default stress behavior.
