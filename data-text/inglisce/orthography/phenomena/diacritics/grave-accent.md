### Function and Distribution

The grave accent is used to:

- Mark **stress** when the stressed syllable cannot be predicted by default rules.  
- Indicate **vowel quality** that deviates from the default pronunciation of the unaccented vowel.  

It typically occurs in **borrowed words** or **morphologically complex words** where orthographic clarity is required.

### Orthographic Contrast

- The grave accent is **not** used for vowel length or tone.  
- Words with default stress and vowel quality remain unaccented.  
- The grave accent coexists with other diacritics only when a **diaeresis** is present; otherwise, a word has at most one accent.  
- See [Acute Accent](acute-accent.md) for rules on stress and vowel quality in other contexts.  
- See [Tildes](tilde.md) for stress interactions with /mj/ and /nj/ sequences.
