## The Grave Accent in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **grave accent** is used on the vowels **à, è, ò**.  
Like the acute accent, it signals both **vowel quality** and **stress**, but applies in different vowel contexts. The grave accent contrasts with the acute by marking **open or lax vowel qualities** in stressed syllables.

**Rule:** Only one accent (acute, grave, or circumflex) appears per word, except when a **diaeresis** is also present.

### Function and Distribution

The grave accent is used to:

- Mark **stress** when the stressed syllable cannot be predicted by default rules.  
- Indicate **vowel quality** that deviates from the default pronunciation of the unaccented vowel.  

It typically occurs in **borrowed words** or **morphologically complex words** where orthographic clarity is required.

See [Acute Accent](acute.md) for stressed vowels with non-open quality.
