## The Circumflex Accent in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **circumflex accent** is used on the vowels **â, î, ê, ô, û**.

Like the acute and grave accents, the circumflex participates in the stress system of Inglisce.  
However, it differs in that it **primarily encodes vowel quality**, and only **secondarily encodes stress**.

Whether a circumflex-marked vowel also indicates stress depends on the **grammatical gender of the noun**:

- In **masculine nouns**, the circumflex marks **vowel quality only**.
- In **feminine nouns**, the circumflex marks **both vowel quality and stress**.

Verbs are not gendered; circumflexes in verbs mark **vowel quality only**, unless stress is independently non-default.

**Rule:** Only one accent (acute, grave, or circumflex) appears per word, except when a **diaeresis** is also present.

### Primary IPA Values

The primary pronunciations of circumflex-marked vowels are as follows:

| Vowel | IPA |
|------|-----|
| â | /eɪ/ |
| î | /aɪ/ |
| ê | /ər/ |
| ô | /æʊ/ or /ʊ/ |
| û | /ʊ/ |

These values reflect historical vowel developments preserved in the orthography, even when surface stress varies.

### Function and Distribution

The circumflex is used to:

- Indicate **non-default vowel quality** arising from diphthongization or r-coloring.  
- Preserve vowel distinctions that would otherwise be lost to vowel reduction.  
- Mark stress **only when required** by grammatical gender.

Unlike the acute and grave accents, which always mark stress, the circumflex must be interpreted **in conjunction with morphological information**.

See [Stress](stress.md) for default stress rules and gender-based stress behavior.

### r-Coloring and ê

The vowel **ê** represents **/ər/** in general.

When followed by **n** or **m**, the **r** is absorbed historically and orthographically:

- **êr + {n, m} → ê**

This reflects r-loss before nasals while preserving the vowel quality encoded by the circumflex.

### Secondary and Contextual Pronunciations

Certain circumflex vowels exhibit predictable secondary pronunciations in specific phonological environments.

#### Contextual Values

All contextual values below are **phonologically automatic** and do not require additional marking.

| Sequence | IPA | Environment |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| aî | /ɛ/ | Reduced diphthong |
| ô | /æʊ/ | Before **-n** or vowels |
| ô | /ʊ/ | Before **-c** or **d** |
| oû | /wʊ/ | Without a preceding consonant |
| oû | /ʊ/ | After a consonant |
| uô | /wʊ/ | Glide formation |
| aû | /æʊ/ | Open diphthong |

These alternations are **fully predictable** and require no additional marking.

### Orthographic Contrast

- The circumflex does **not** indicate vowel length or tone.  
- It differs from the acute and grave accents in that stress marking is **conditional**, not automatic.  
- Circumflex vowels may appear in **unstressed syllables** when vowel quality must be preserved.
- See [Acute Accent](acute-accent.md) and [Grave Accent](grave-accent.md) for stress-first diacritics.
- See [Tildes](tilde.md) for consonantal diacritics that interact with stress indirectly.
