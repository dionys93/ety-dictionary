## The Acute Accent in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **acute accent** is used on the vowels **á, í, é, ó, ú**.

The acute accent signals two things simultaneously:

1. **Vowel quality** – it indicates a specific pronunciation for the vowel.  
2. **Stress** – it marks the stressed syllable in a word when stress is not predictable by default rules.

### IPA Pronunciations

| Vowel | IPA |
|-------|-----|
| á | /ɑ/ |
| í | /i/ |
| é | /e/ |
| ó | /oʊ/ |
| ú | /ju/ or /u/ |

### Function and Distribution

The acute accent is used primarily to:

- Mark stress when it deviates from default stress assignment.  
- Preserve vowel quality that would otherwise be reduced or altered in unstressed syllables.  

Accented vowels occur wherever stress is non-predictable, especially in borrowed or morphologically complex words. The accent ensures that both **pronunciation** and **syllable prominence** are clear.

### Orthographic Contrast

The acute accent is not used to indicate vowel length or tone.  
Unaccented vowels are assumed to follow default quality and stress rules.  
In combination with other diacritics (such as the tilde), the acute accent only appears on the syllable where stress or quality must be explicitly signaled.
