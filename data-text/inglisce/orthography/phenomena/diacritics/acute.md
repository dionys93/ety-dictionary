## The Acute Accent in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **acute accent** is used on the vowels **á, í, é, ó, ú**.

The acute accent signals two things simultaneously:

1. **Vowel quality** – it indicates a specific pronunciation for the vowel.  
2. **Stress** – it marks the stressed syllable in a word when stress is not predictable by default rules.

The acute accent never appears on syllables whose stress and vowel quality are fully predictable by default rules.

**Rule:** Only one accent (acute, grave, or circumflex) appears per word, except when a **diaeresis** is also present.


### IPA Pronunciations

| Vowel | IPA |
|-------|-----|
| á | /ɑ/ |
| í | /i/ |
| é | /e/ |
| ó | /oʊ/ |
| ú | /ju/ or /u/ |

### Function and Distribution

The acute accent is used primarily to:

- Mark stress when it deviates from default stress assignment.  
- Preserve vowel quality that would otherwise be reduced or altered in unstressed syllables.  

Accented vowels occur wherever **stress or vowel quality** is non-predictable, especially in borrowed or morphologically complex words. The accent ensures that both **pronunciation** and **syllable prominence** are clear.

When an acute accent appears, the vowel is **always stressed**.
See [Stress](stress.md) for default stress patterns and the conditions under which stress must be explicitly marked.
