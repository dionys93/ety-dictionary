## The Cedilla in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **cedilla** (or **comma below**, where font support requires it) is used to represent specific consonant sounds consistently and transparently.

Cedillas may appear only on the letters **c, d, s, t** and **x**.

Their primary purpose is to preserve **etymological continuity** while clearly marking **predictable sound changes** that arise in English derivation.

---

### Function and Scope

Cedillas in Inglisce are used to:

- Preserve relationships between base forms and their derivatives  
- Mark consonant softening and affrication systematically  
- Reduce ambiguity in environments where English spelling is inconsistent  

They do **not** indicate stress, vowel quality, or syllable structure.

## Assibilation

**Assibilation** is a regular phonological process in which non-sibilant consonants—most commonly **t** and **d**—shift to sibilant or affricate sounds when followed by a high front vowel, especially **/i/**.

In Inglisce, assibilation occurs most visibly in **morphologically derived forms**, particularly those formed with the suffix **-ion**.

This process is not sporadic or stylistic: it is **predictable, historically grounded, and systematic**, especially in vocabulary of Latin origin. As a result, Inglisce encodes assibilation **orthographically** rather than leaving it implicit.

---

### Assibilation in -ion Derivation

When verbs ending in **-t** or **-d** combine with **-ion**, the consonant is brought into direct contact with a high front vowel. This environment reliably triggers assibilation.

| Base Verb | Derived Noun | Resulting Sound |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| explode | explósion | /ʒ/ |
| erode | erósion | /ʒ/ |
| decîde | decision | /ʒ/ |
| provîde | provision | /ʒ/ |
| criâte | criâcion | /ʃ/ |
| navigait | navigâcion | /ʃ/ |
| graḑuait | graḑuâcion | /ʤ/ |

In each case, the underlying consonant remains morphologically present, but its **surface realization changes** due to the phonological environment introduced by the suffix.

---

### Orthographic Encoding in Inglisce

Rather than obscuring these relationships (as traditional English spelling often does), Inglisce preserves them by using **cedillas and related consonantal diacritics**:

- **t → ț / ci**
- **d → d̦ / si**
- **c → ç**

This allows derived forms such as **graḑuait → graḑuâcion** or **assoçiait → assoçiâcion** to remain visibly connected to their bases while clearly encoding the phonological shift.

Assibilation therefore motivates the **existence and necessity** of consonantal diacritics in Inglisce: they preserve both **phonological accuracy** and **morphological transparency**.

### Additional Examples

**/ʒ/ outcomes**
- to corrode + ion → **corrósion**
- to envâde + ion → **envâsion**
- to persuâde + ion → **persuâsion**
- to collîde + ion → **collision**
- to divîde + ion → **division**

**/ʃ/ outcomes**
- to vâcait + ion → **vacâcion**
- to assoçiait + ion → **assoçiâcion**
- to apríçiait + ion → **apriçiâcion**
- to iniçiait + ion → **iniçiâcion**
- to negoçiait + ion → **negoçiâcion**
- to diffrençiait + ion → **diffrençiâcion**
- to repúdiait + ion → **repudiâcion**
- to mitigait + ion → **mitigâcion**

---

### Orthographic Contrast

- Cedillas are **not optional stylistic markers**; they encode phonological information.
- Unmarked **c, d, s, t, x** retain their default values.
- Cedillas allow Inglisce to maintain Romance-style **derivational transparency** without sacrificing phonetic clarity. 

See [Diacritics Overview](diacritics-overview.md) for a comparison with vowel and consonantal diacritics.

### Summary

Cedillas in Inglisce serve to:

1. Preserve etymological relationships between word families  
2. Indicate consonant shifts that arise during English derivation  
3. Reduce spelling ambiguity through consistent sound marking  

This system maintains visible links between base forms (*juce, spâce, slîce, acte*) and their derivatives, while clearly encoding the phonological changes that occur.
