## The Circumflex Accent in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **circumflex accent** is used on the vowels **â, î, ê, ô, û**.

Like the acute and grave accents, the circumflex participates in the stress system of Inglisce.  
However, the circumflex differs in that it **primarily encodes vowel quality**, and only **secondarily encodes stress**.

Whether a circumflex-marked vowel also indicates stress depends on the **grammatical gender and stress class of the word**. In some environments, the circumflex marks vowel quality alone; in others, it marks both vowel quality and stress.

**Rule:** Only one accent (acute, grave, or circumflex) appears per word, except when a **diaeresis** is also present.

### Primary IPA Values

The primary pronunciations of circumflex-marked vowels are as follows:

| Vowel | IPA |
|------|-----|
| â | /eɪ/ |
| î | /aɪ/ |
| ê | /ər/ |
| ô | /æʊ/ or /ʊ/ |
| û | /ʊ/ |

These values reflect historical vowel developments and are preserved orthographically even when stress behavior varies.

### Function and Distribution

The circumflex is used to:

- Indicate **non-default vowel quality** arising from historical diphthongization or r-coloring.  
- Preserve vowel distinctions that would otherwise collapse under default vowel reduction.  
- Mark stress **only when required** by the word’s stress class or grammatical gender.

Unlike the acute and grave accents, which reliably mark stress, the circumflex must be interpreted **in conjunction with morphological and grammatical information**.

See [Stress](stress.md) for default stress rules and gender-based stress behavior.

### Secondary and Contextual Pronunciations

The vowels **î, ê, ô, û** may take **secondary pronunciations** in specific phonological environments, especially when adjacent to certain vowels or consonants.

#### Contextual Values

| Sequence | IPA | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| aî | /ɛ/ | Reduced diphthong |
| ô | /æʊ/ | Before **-n** or vowels |
| ô | /ʊ/ | Before **-c**, or after **h** or **u** |
| oû | /wʊ/ | Word-initial or without preceding consonant |
| oû | /ʊ/ | After consonants |
| uô | /wʊ/ | Glide formation |
| aû | /æʊ/ | Open diphthong |

These alternations are predictable and do not require additional marking.

### Orthographic Contrast

- The circumflex does **not** indicate vowel length or tone.  
- It differs from the acute and grave accents in that stress marking is **context-dependent**, not automatic.  
- Circumflex vowels may appear in unstressed syllables when vowel quality must be preserved.  
- See [Acute Accent](acute-accent.md) and [Grave Accent](grave-accent.md) for stress-first diacritics.
- See [Tildes](tilde.md) for consonantal diacritics that interact indirectly with stress.
