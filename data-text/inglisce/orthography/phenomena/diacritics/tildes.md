## Tildes in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **tilde** is used on **m̃** and **ñ**.

The tilde represents represents the consonantal units **/mj/** and **/nj/**
respectively. These letters reflect a historical–phonological development in which a nasal consonant is immediately followed by a palatal glide.

Orthographically, the tilde signals that the nasal and the following *yod* form a single complex unit rather than a simple consonant–vowel sequence.

### Function and Distribution

The tilde is used when the sequences **/mj/** and **/nj/** occur before a vowel and would otherwise be obscured by vowel reduction or orthographic simplification. In such environments, unstressed **/ə/** is written as **o** after nasals; the tilde preserves the presence of the yod while maintaining predictable stress behavior.

### Orthographic Contrast

The sequences **/mj/** and **/nj/** are not written as **my** or **ny**, as this would falsely suggest a vowel sequence and interfere with stress assignment. The tilde instead marks the nasal as forming a single consonantal unit with the yod.
