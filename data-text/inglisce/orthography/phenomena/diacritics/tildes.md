## Tildes in Inglisce

### Overview

In Inglisce, the **tilde** is used on **m̃** and **ñ**.

The tilde represents the consonant sequences **/mj/** and **/nj/** respectively. These sequences reflect a historical–phonological development in which a nasal consonant is immediately followed by a palatal glide.

Orthographically, the tilde signals that the nasal and the following *yod* form a single complex unit rather than a simple consonant–vowel sequence.
