Printing addes to þe muddle

William Caxton first set up in bisness as a printeur in Bruges (nôu in Belgiom). 
Ћere in 1473 hie mâde þe first printed bôc in Inglisce, þe "Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye". 
Caxton retorned to Ingland in 1476 and set up a press in Ouestminstre. 
Ћe first bôc gnone to have bign printed þere uas Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" (Canterbury Tâls).

Caxton's spelling uas bâssed on þe Chancery Standard, to uich hie added hisone vâriants. 
Sadly, þô printing broht meny advàntages, it also added to þi irregulâretie of þe spelling sistem. 
Ћe printeurs Caxton broht uiþ'im from þe Loa Contris uere unúsed to þi Inglisce lânguage and mâde spelling errors, 
eg any, busy, citie for eny, bisy, cittie. (Inglisce: eny, bisy, citie)
Ћey also somtîms used Dutch spellings, soch as adding an h after g, torning uords lîc "gost" into "ghost." 
Alþô meny of þe chânges þey mâde uere lâtar uieded aut, som of'em, lîc ghost (goast) and ghastly (gastly), are still uiþ os.

Ћe printeurs also tended to laingþane uords. Ћis uas drivan partly by monie – þey uere paied by þe nombre of ligns printed – 
and partly by pâge layaut, soch as mâcuing þe roiht-hand sîde of þe texte ligne up nietly. 
Meny simple spellings becâme more complèx, eg frend > friend, hed > head, seson > season, fondnes > fondnesse, shal > shall. 
Houevre in þis þe printeurs uere only follouing þe cențuris-ôld pràctice of þe lígal scrîbs, 
hu uere paied by þi inch for þeir rîting. (Inglisce: frend, hede, síson, fondness, sial)

Anoþre factor uas þe printing of þe first Inglisce bîbels at þe tîme of þa Reformâcion. 
Meny of þise uere printed abraude for fiar of persecúcion, as producing a bîble in Inglisce uas regarded as heresie. 
Ћe ricópying from texts þat uere alrèdy corropt and þe use of nón-Inglisce-spiecuing printeurs in Europ added to þa diversetie of spellings. 
As þere uere no diccionairis, and feu beox of eny cŷnd, píple tended to cópie þe spellings þey faund in eny vêsion of þe bîble þey coûd lôcue at.
