Printing addes to þe muddle

William Caxton first set up in bisness as a printeur in Bruges (nao in Belgiom). 
Ћere in 1473 hie mâde þe first printed bôc in Inglisce, þe "Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye". 
Caxton retorned to Ingland in 1476 and set up a press in Ouestminstre. 
Ћe first bôc noun ta have bìn printed þere uas Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" (Canterbury Tâls).

Caxton's spelling uas bâssed on þe Chancery Standard, to uich hie added hisone vâriants. 
Sadly, þô printing broht meny advàntages, it also added to þi irregulâretie of þe spelling sistem. 
Ћe printeurs Caxton broht uiþ him from þe Loa Contris uere unúsed to þi Inglisce lânguage and mâde spelling errors, 
eg any, busy, citie for eny, bisy, cittie. (Inglisce: eny, bisy, citti)
Ћey also somtîms used Dutch spellings, such as adding an h after g, toûning uords lîc "gost" into "ghost." 
Alþô meny of þe chânges þey mâde uere lâter uided aut, som of'em, lîc ghost (goast) and ghastly (gastly), are still uiþ os.

Ћe printeurs also tended ta léngþen uords. Ћis uas driven partly by moni – þey uere paied by þe nombre of ligns printed – 
and partly by pâge layaot, such as mâking þe ryht-hand sîde of þe text ligne up nietly. 
Meny simple spellings becâme more complèx, eg frend > friend, hed > head, seson > season, fondnes > fondnesse, shal > shall. 
Haoevre in þis þe printeurs uere only fólouing þe cenȶuries-old pràctice of þe lígal scrîbs, 
hu uere paied by þi inch for þeir urîting. (Inglisce: frend, hed, síson, fondness, shal)

Anoþer factor uas þe printing of þe first Inglisce bîbels at þe tîme of þa Reformâcion. 
Meny of þise uere printed abraude for fier of persec̃ucion, as producing a bîble in Inglisce uas regarded as heresi. 
Ћe ricópying from texts þat uere alrèdy corrùpt and þe euss of nón-Inglisce-spieking printeurs in Europ added to þa diverseti of spellings. 
As þere uere no diccionairies, and feu bôcs of eny kînd, píple tended ta cópie þe spellings þey fáund in eny vêsion of þe bîble þey coûd lûq at.
