Ћi Inglisce rîting sistem

Inglish has groɯn from þe lânguage broht to Brittan in þe 5þ cenȶurie by Ânglo-Saxon invâdeurs from Norþ Gêmani. 
Its histori is eus̃ally divîded into þri main faises:

Old Inglish – from þi arrîval of þi invâdeurs in þe 5þ cenȶuri to araond 1130
Middle Inglish – roffly 1130 to 1470
Módirn Inglish – abaot 1470 to þe prèsent

Haoevre þere ɯere meny chânges ɯiþin ích faise – for example Êly Módirn Inglish (roffly 1470 to 1700) is sine as distínct from truely Módirn Inglish. 
In rialeti, of corse, chânge has bìn ongoɯing þru all þe faises.

Ћe Roman àlfabet and Latin ɯere eused in Brittan ɯhen it ɯas part of þe Roman Empaer (AD 43 to 410), 
and þey staied in euss in þe Qeltic parts of þa Brittish Îles after most of þe Romans left.

Haoevre, þi invâdeurs broht ɯiþ'em þe rúnic àlfabet, noɯn as þe futhorc from its fêst six letres. 
A feɯ small exampels of Old Inglish ɯritten in runes have sôvîved. 
Ћere ɯere at þat tîme alrèdy sevral distínct Inglish dîalecs bâssed roffly on þe seprat kingdoms of Ânglo-Saxon Ingland.

In 597 St Augustine câme from Rome to Canterburi and converted þe Saxons in Kent to Cristianeti. 
After þis þe Crisȶan monks started eusing þe Roman àlfabet ta ɯrîte Inglish. 
As þe Roman àlfabet did not have enoff letres, þey also eused som runes, such as Þ (called þôn) for the þ saonds in þis and þin. 
At þis staige, Inglish spelling ɯas mostly fairly simple, as þe letres mached þe spoken ɯords quîte ɯell.

Mâjor sôvîving ɯorx in Old Inglish include þi "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Bede's "History of the Christian Church in England" (transleted into Old Inglish from Bede's Latin), and þe sága Beoɯulf.
