Ћi êly diccionairie ɯrîteurs

By þi end of þe 16þ cenȶuri, þi uncêrtan and vâriable stâte of Inglish spelling lèd to calls for its controle. 
Ћe fêst person ta ɯrîte a bûc of corrèct spelling in Êly Módirn Inglish ɯas Richard Mulcaster, fêst hedmastre of Merchant Taylors' Scule, 
and lâter Hîh Mastre of St Paule's Scule, bôþ in London, hu publiçed "The first Part of the Elementarie" in 1582.

Hie ɯas to som extente a spelling refômeur, althô hie ɯas more intrested in tîdying up spelling þan in mâking radical chânges. 
His bûc conténed only abaot 8000 ɯords, far short of a módirn diccionairi. 
Oun of þe chânges hie proposed ɯas ta euse þe letres ie instèd of y at þi end of a ɯord, ɯhen þey ɯeren't stressed, as in gentlie. 
Ћis allaoed y ta bie eused for the lòng stressed vaole, as in try (trîe).

Anoþer spelling-bûc wrîteur ɯas Edmund Coote, also a sculemastre, hu publiçed his "English Schoole-maister" in 1596. 
Coote, unlîc Mulcaster, ɯas not concêned at all ɯiþ mâking spelling more consistent. 
Hie just ɯanted ta settle on a single spelling for ích ɯord, and opted for þe oun most eused.

Samuel Johnson's diccionairi of 1755 ɯas þe most comprihènsif of its tîme and has had a grete influence in þi Inglish spieking Ɯorld. 
Haoevre, lîc Coote, Johnson ɯas not at all intrested in refôme but raþer chose ɯhat hie regarded as þe most cómon spellings.

Hie ɯas also concêned þat homograffs — diffrent ɯords þat are spelled the sâme, 
eg bow (þe weppon boɯ, etc) and bow (ta bende þi upper bódi, ta baoe) — coûd lide to missondrestandings. 
Hie þerefore chose altênatif spellings ta reflecte diffrences in miening, 
such as stile (steps over a bârrior, Inglish: stîhle) and style (Inglish: stîle, of art, ɯrîting, etc). 
Before compîling þe Diccionairi, hie himself had ɯritten '…the rules of stile, like those of law, arise from precedents…' (Plan of a Dictionary, 1747). 
Haoevre, oun effecte of all þis ɯas ta mâke lêning ta spelle Inglish ɯords íven more difficult.
