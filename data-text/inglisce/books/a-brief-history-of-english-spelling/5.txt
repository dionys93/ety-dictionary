Ћe sônd of Inglisce altres

Uan of þi impôrtant factors in þe difficultie of Inglisce spelling today comes from a chânge in þe sônd of spocan Inglisce 
uich tôc plâce grad̦ally betuine þe 15þ and þi êly 17þ cențuris. 
Ћis affected maignly þe sevon lòng vouals of Middle Inglisce, and is gnone as þe Great Vouale Scifte. 
It uas first studied and nâmed by þe Dânish lingüist Otto Jespersen (1860–1943).

Ћe sônd of som of þise vouals has altred furþar betuine þe 17þ cențurie and today. 
Ћe chânges did not all tâcue plâce at þe sâm tîme, and þere uere more staiges þan þose seon in þe tâble on þe roiht. 
Som of þe sônds invòlved are no lòngar used in standard Inglisce, and þere is no distínct spelling for'em.

Ћe tâble uses today's normal spelling alòng uiþ þe sônds of módern UQ standard soþern Inglisce 
to seoe very roffly þe maign chânges in þe sônds þat uere and are nôu spocan. 
Only þe vaole sônd in þe uord is relevant.

For þe moast part, þe spelling did not chânge to folloe þe sônds, þuss incricing þe diffrence betuine þe ritan and spocan uord. 
As lât as þi êly 18þ cențurie, Alexander Pope uas rhyming tea (tie) uiþ obey (obeie) instaid of uiþ bee (bíe) 
(þe second ligne in þe tâble above seouing bay/bee/bee is þe uan þat refês).
