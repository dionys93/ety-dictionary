Inglish spelling since Johnson

Inglish spelling has sine only mînor chânges since Johnson, but þere have bìn meny of'em. 
For instance þere is no longuer a k on þi end of meny ɯords like musick and frantick. 
Ћise chânges have hapend graᶁally and ɯiþaot eny planing.

Ћe main excepȶon ɯas þe mâking of an Amèrican standard by Noah Webster in þi êly 19þ cenȶury. 
Webster bâssed his diccionairie on ɯhat hie þoht ɯas þen þe current spelling in Norþ Amèrica, but hie ɯas also a refômeur.

Today som US spellings are slîhtly diffrent from Brittish ouns, 
eg check/cheque, labor/labour, defense/defence, specialize/specialise. 

Haoevre, þis has not necessârily mâde Amèrican spellings more reg̃ular þan þose in Brittan. 
For example color and colour are accially pronaonced culler on bôþ sîds of þi Atlantic. 
In contrast, þe sâme ɯord in Spanish is ɯritten color, maching þe spoken ɯord col-or perfectly. 
(Inglish fóloes þe Latin and Spanish: color)

Arg̃uably þe fêst ɯas þi Ormulum of þe 12þ cenȶurie, produced by a clèric nâmed Orm hu ɯrote in þi Íst Midlands dîalect.

Ћe fêst mâjor attempte in módirn tîms ɯas lèd by EuSA Prèsident Theodore Roosevelt in þi êly 20þ cenȶuri. 
Ћis ɯas bâssed on som of þe proposed refôms for ɯhich Webster had failed ta guet general aprouval. 
It rane into êly resìstance and ɯas ultimatly blocked by Cóngress.

In þi Eu.K. a prîvat membre's bill ɯas passed by þe Brittish Haoʃ of Cómons in 1953, 
but in þi end had ta bie ɯiþdraɯn due to opposicion by þe Ministri of Eᶁucâcion.

Meny oþre propôsals have bìn mâde over þe yiers, 
but Inglish spelling remaines þe most irreg̃ular of all spelling sistems þat are bâssed on þi alfabetic principle.
