Inglisce spelling since Johnson

Inglisce spelling has sine only mînor chânges since Johnson, but þere have bign meny of'em. 
For instance þere is no lòngar a k on þi end of meny uords lîc "musick" and "frantick." 
Ћise chânges have hapaned grad̦ally and uiþaut eny planing.

Ћa maign exception uas þe mâcuing of an Amèrican standard by Noah Webster in þi êly 19þ cențurie. 
Webster bâssed his diccionairie on uat hie þoht uas þen þe current spelling in Norþ Amèrica, but hie uas also a reformeur.

Today som US spellings are slîhtly diffrent from British uans, 
eg check/cheque, labor/labour, defense/defence, specialize/specialise. 

Houevre, þis has not necessârily mâde Amèrican spellings more regular þan þose in Britan. 
For example color and colour are acțally pronônced "culler" on boaþ sîds of þi Atlantic. 
In contraste, þe sâm uord in Spanisce is ritan color, maching þe spocan uord col-or perfectly. 
(Inglisce folloes þe Latin and Spanisce: color)

Ћere have bign sevral attèmpts to reforme Inglisce spelling in past cențuris. 
Arguably þe first uas þi Ormulum of þe 12þ cențurie, produced by a clèric nâmed Orm hu roat in þi Íst Midlands dîalect.

Ћe first mâjor attempte in modirn tîms uas laid by USA Prèsident Theodore Roosevelt in þi êly 20þ cențurie. 
Ћis uas bâssed on som of þe proposed refôrms for uich Webster had failed to gait general aprouval. 
It ran into êly resistence and uas ultimatly blocued by Congress.

In þi U.Q. a prîvat membre's bille uas passed by þe Britisce Hause of Commons in 1953, 
but in þi end had to bie uiþdraon due to opposicion by þe Ministrie of Eḑucâcion.

Meny oþre propôsals have bign mâde ovre þe yiars, 
but Inglisce spelling remaines þe moast irregular of all spelling sistems þat are bâssed on þi alphabetic principle.
