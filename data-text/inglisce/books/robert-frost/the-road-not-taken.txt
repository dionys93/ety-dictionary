Ћe Road Not Tâcan

Tu roads divêged in a yello uôd,
And sòrry I coûd not travle boaþ 
And bie uan travleur, lòng I stôd
And lôcued dôn uan as far as I coûd
To ouere it bent in þi ondregroeþ;

Ћen tôc þi oþre, as jost as fair,
And having perhaps þe bettar clâme,
Becase it uas grassy and uanted ueire;
Ћo as for þat þe passing þere
Had uôrn þem rilly abaut þe sâm,

And boaþ þat môrning iqually lay
In liefs no step had trodan blac.
Oh, I caipt þe first for anoþre daie!
Yet gnouing hôu uaie lides on to uaie,
I dôuted if I seûd evre come bac.

I sial bie telling þis uiþ a syhe
Somouere âges and âges hence:
Tu roads divêged in a uôd, and I—
I tôc þe uan less travled by,
And þat has mâde all þe diffrence.
