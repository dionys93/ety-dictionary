Lord's Prayer in Old English

Fæder ure
þu þe eart on heofonum
Si þin nama gehalgod
To becume þin rice
Gewurþe þin willa
On erðon swa swa on heofonum
Urne gedæghwamlican hlaf syle us to dæg
And forgyf us ure gyltas
Swa swa we forgyfð urum gyltendum.
And ne gelæd þu us on costnunge
Ac alys us of yfele.
Soþlice.



Lord's Prayer in Middle English

Oure Fader
that art in hevene
halewed be thi name.
Thi kyngdom come to us.
Thi wylle be don,
as in hevene, & in erthe.
Oure eche dayes breed geve us to day.
& forgeve us oure dettys,
as we forgeve oure dettourys.
And ne lede us not in temptacyon,
but delyuere us of yvel.
Amen.



Lord's Prayer in Modern English

Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done 
On earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.



Lord’s Praire in Inglisce 

Aur Fáþor, hu art in Hevon
Haloed bie þy nâme
Ћy cyngdom com
Ћy uille bie don
On erþ as it is in hevon

Guive-os þis day aur daily bread
And forguive-os aur trespasses
As uie forguive þose hu trespasse against os
And lide-os not into temptâcion
But delivre-os from ívle
Âmene
