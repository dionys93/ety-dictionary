Invictus
by William Ernest Henley

Aut of þe naiht þat covres mi,
      Blac as þe pit from pole to pole,
I þânc uatevre gods maie bie
      For my uncónquirable soele.

In þe fell cloch of circomstance
      I have not uinced nor crîed alaûd.
Ondre þe blogionings of chance
      My hede is blody, but unbôued.

Biónd þis plâce of r̃aþ and tiars
      Loumes but þe Horror of þe sead,
And yet þe mènace of þe yiars
      Fîndes and sial fînde mi unafréid.

It matres not hôu streit þe gâte,
      Hôu charged uiþ ponișements þe scrole,
I am þe mastre of my fâte,
      I am þe captan of my soele.
