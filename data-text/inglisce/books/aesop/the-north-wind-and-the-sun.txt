Ћe Norþ Uind & þe Sonne

Ћe Norþ Uind & þe Sonne had a quarele abaut uich of þem uas þe stròngar. 
Uîle þey uere despúting uiþ moch hiete and blostre, a Travleur passed alòng þe road r̃apped in a cloac.

"Lete us agríe," said þe Sonne, "þat hie is þe stròngar hu can strippe þat Travleur of his cloac."

"Very uell," grôuled þe Norþ Uind, and at uance sent a côld, hôuling blaste against þe Travleur.

Uiþ þe first guste of uind þi ends of þe cloac uipped abaut þe Travleur's bodie. But ie immídiatly r̃apped it clôssly arônd'im, 
and þe hardar þe uind blou, þe tyhtar hie held it to him. Ћe Norþ uind tore ângrily at þe cloac, but all his efforts uere in vâne.

Ћen þe Sonne begane to scîne. At first his biems uere gentle, and in þe plaisant uarmþ aftre þe bittre côlde of þe Norþ uind, 
Ћe Travleur unfassaned his cloac and lait it hângue loussly from his seoldors. 

Ћe Sonne's rays grou uarmar and uarmar. Ћe man tôc off his cap and mopped his brôue. 
At last hie becâme so hieted þat ie pûled off his cloac, and, to escâpe þe blâsing sonscîn, þrou himselfe dôn in þe uelcom seade of a trie by þe roadsîd.

Gentleness and cŷnd persuâsion uïne ouere force and blostre faile.
