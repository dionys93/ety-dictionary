If you iven gait þat far! You’re bent on þi impóssible.

Uene you’re laied to reste, you’ll fînde þat iven þe daid hâte you—
And roihtly so. Lievfe-mi and my foulish plane
To sofir aur terrible fâte! 
Ћere is no ponișement hôrrible enoff
To quipe mi from daihing a beutiful daiþ.

ISMÍNI
Goe on þen, if you þincue it best—you’re a foule to goe, 
But your loved uans still love you.
