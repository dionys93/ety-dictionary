Feuri and slautre lîc þe ɯinds of a ɯîld stôme.
Yet þise þrets toûned aot oþreɯîs,
And to oþre foes great Âries
Dailt oþre blôs, ɯorkhorse of battle.
For seven comandeurs stûd at sevon gâts 
And left behînd in iqual seare þeir panoplies of brass
To Zeúʃ, toûneur of þe battle’s tîde—
Excèpt for þose tu ɯrechid ouns, 
Bône from þe sâm maþor and fáþor, 
Hu stûd and drove þeir spírs against ích oþre, 
Bôþ strîking victori,
Bôþ fînding deþ in iqual shair.
Since glory-granting Nîki has com
To Ћibes of meny châriots, a smîle for a smîle,
Lette’s mâke arselfs forguetful
Of þe ɯaurs of ricent past;
Lette’s mâke ar ɯay to þe tempels of þe gods
Ta dance all þru þe náit;
Let Báccus lide þe dance as hie seâkes þi erþ of Ћibes!
(DANCE INTRELUDE)
But, beholde, þe kingue of þe land—
Créon, son of Menoikéaʃ, þe nu ruleur
By þe ricent forȶons ɯhich þe gods have sent his ɯay—
Hie comes!
Ɯhat nu laɯ dus hie so hâstily intende,
Since hie’s sent ɯord þat þi eldeurs
Are ta gaþre and discusse a special iss̃ue?
