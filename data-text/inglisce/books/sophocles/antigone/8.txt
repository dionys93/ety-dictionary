Fúrie and slautre lîc þe uinds of a uîld storme.
Yet þise þrets torned aut oþreuîs,
And to oþre fôs great Âries
Dailt oþre blôs, uorc-horse of battle.
For sevon comandeurs stôd at sevon gâts 
And laift behînd in iqual seare þeir panoplis of brass
To Zeús, torneur of þe battle’s tîde—
Excèpt for þose tu rechid uans, 
Bôrn from þe sâm maþor and fáþor, 
Hu stôd and droave þeir spiers against ích oþre, 
Boaþ strîcuing victorie,
Boaþ fînding daiþ in iqual seare.
Since glory-granting Nîqui has com
To Ћibes of meny châriots, a smîle for a smîle,
Lete’s mâcue aurselfs forgaitful
Of þe guars of ricent past;
Lete’s mâcue aur uaie to þe tempels of þe gods
To dance all þru þe naiht;
Lete Báccus lide þe dance as hie seacs þi erþ of Ћibes!
(DANCE INTRELUDE)
But, behôlde, þe quingue of þe land—
Créon, son of Menoikéias, þe nou reuleur
By þe ricent forțons uich þe gods have sent his uaie—
Hie comes!
Uat nou lahe dus hie so hâstily intende,
Since hie’s sent uord þat þi eldeurs
Are to gaþer and discusse a special isșue?
