ANTÏGONI
Ismíni, suiet Ismíni, my diar sistor!
Uill Zeús, in aur lîfetîm, spaire os
From þe trobuls of Edipus?
You and I have alrèdy soffred 
Evry peine, evry desastre, evry seame, 
Evry disònor in aurone trobuls.
Nôu—uat’s þis nou decríe
Ћey saie þe general has imposed upón þe citie? 
Have you hêd uord of aur broþors,
Or do þe crîms of aur enemis falle on deff iars?

ISMÍNI
I’ve hêd noþing nou, ANTÏGONI, of aur broþors,
Gûd or bad. No uan has com
Since uie tu sistors lòst aur tu broþors,
Daid on a single day, ích by þi oþre’s hand.
Ћi Arguîve armie disapired in þe naiht—
I gnoe noþing more
Of uat is to come of mi.

ANTÏGONI
Ћat’s oîe I called you hiere uiþ mi,
Autsîde þe gâts, so only you oûd hyre.

ISMÍNI
Uat is it? Ћere simes to bie a storme in you.

ANTÏGONI
Hasn’t Créon ónored uan of aur broþors in bèrial, 
But not þi oþre?
Etíoclies, þey saie, has bign tucued aüay
Benieþ þi erþ, ónored among þe daid belô
uiþ formal obsirvâcion of rîte and custom.
But Créon has proclâmed
Ћat no uan sial grieve nor laie to reste
Ћat torțured corpse I still calle Polynéiquis—
Hie sial bie laift unuèpt, unbèried, a suiet treșure
For þe vulțurs as þey cerche for þe grâce of flesce.
Gûd Créon has denîed you and mi—
Iven mi!—þis rîte.
Hie’s coming hiere to proclâme it publicly
So non are ignorant, and þise are not just uords—hie mienes to acte.
Ћe ponișement sial bie daiþ by public stoning.
Ћis is þe troble you’re in, and you uill soun reviele
oueþre þe virțue of aur ancestors rones þru your véins.
