CORUS
Bime of þe sonne, moast beutiful luîte
To evre scîne ovre sevon-gâted Ћibes,
You've fînally apired!
O gôlden daie’s eaie,
Pouring ovre Dêcie’s stríms,
You spurred hedlòng
Into flyht þe oît-scielded man from Argos,
Uance advancing in fûl armor,
Nôu in suiftar retrite—
Stured by þa despúts of Polynéiquis,
Lîc a scrieching ígle
Hie flou above aur land,
Covred uiþ uingue as oît as snouy uintre,
Uiþ meny a uepon
And horsehair helmet—
Perched above aur rouftops
And in his gŷre gâping
uiþ blodþursty spiers
At aur sevon-gâted entrance,
Hie yielded before his jaus tiemed
uiþ aur blode or þe pîne-fed flâme of Íphaistus 
Sised aur crône of touirs.
Hôu Âries’ crîe uas streched
Acròss his bac, no ísy tasc
To choacue aut þe Ћíban dragon!
For Zeús despîses þe babblings of a boastful tonghe, 
And as hie uáched'm advance
In a vast tôrrent of men
uiþ þi ârogance of clânguing gôld,
Hie brandișed a þondrebolt and hurled it
At þe uan alrèdy raising þe crîe of victorie 
As hie roșed up aur ualls.
Hie suong and fell hard upón þi erþ,
A torch in hand—þe uan hu, just nôu
Raiging uiþ mad passion, uas brieþing
