CORUS
Bime of þe sun, most beutiful lyht
To evre shîne over seven-gâted Ћibes,
You've fînally apired!
O gôlden day’s eye,
Pouring over Dêcie’s stríms,
You spured hedlòng
Into flyht þe ɯhîte-shielded man from Argoʃ,
Uonce advancing in fûl ámor,
Nao in suifter retrite—
Stured by þa disp̃utes of Polynéikiʃ,
Lîc a scrieching ígle
Hie flou above ar land,
Covred ɯiþ ɯingue as oît as snouy uintre,
Ɯiþ meny a ɯepon
And horsehair helmet—
Perched above ar rouftops
And in his gyre gâping
Ɯiþ bludþursty spírs
At ar seven-gâted entrance,
Hie yielded before his jaɯs tiemed
Ɯiþ ar blud or þe pîne-fèd flâme of Ífaistoʃ 
Sised ar craon of taors.
Hao Âris’ crîe ɯas streched
Acròss his back, no ísy task
Ta choq aot þe Ћíban dragon!
For Zeúʃ despîses þe babblings of a bôstful tonghe, 
And as hie ɯáched'm advance
In a vast tôrrent of men
Ɯiþ þi ârogance of clânguing gôld,
Hie brandiçed a þondrebôlt and hurled it
At þe oun alrèdy raising þe crîe of victorie 
As hie rushed up ar ɯalls.
Hie sɯong and fell hard upón þi erþ,
A torch in hand—þe oun hu, just nao
Raiging ɯiþ mad passion, ɯas brieþing
