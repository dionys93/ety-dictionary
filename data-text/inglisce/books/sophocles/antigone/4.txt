ISMÍNI
Oh my paur sistor, if þis is treu,
Uat’s þe point in meddling?

ANTÏGONI
Considre oueþre you’ll helpe mi.

ISMÍNI
Helpe you uiþ uat? Uat are you þincuing?

ANTÏGONI
Uill you lende þis hand to bèrie his corpse?

ISMÍNI
Do you rilly miene to bèrie'm, iven þô it’s against þe lahe?

ANTÏGONI
I uill dou my part—and yours, tou, if you uon’t—
To bèrie aur broþor. I uon’t bie cauht betraying him.

ISMÍNI
Hôu can you bie so stubborn? Créon forbïdes it.

ANTÏGONI
Hie has no roiht to quipe mi from myone.

ISMÍNI
Oh god! sistor, don’t forgait hôu aur fáþor daihed, 
Raiging and infamus!
Hôu, uene hie discovred þe sins of his past,
Hie tore his eays to pieces, blînded by hisone hand!
Hôu þat uôman hu uas boaþ his maþor and his uîfe
Pût an end to her lîfe uiþ a tuisted nouss!
Hôu, fînally, aur tu sad broþors slue ích oþre on þe sâm daie, 
Ich uan rieching þeir cómon demîse at þe hands of þi oþre.
Uie’re alone in þis uorld—ôpane your eays and sihe
Hôu agonysing aur daiþs uill bie
If uie defîe þis ordre and breicue þe lahe,
Or stepe on þe toes of tyrants in eny uaie.
You’ve got to remember þat uie are uimmen—
Uie aren’t maint to foihte battels uiþ men.
Uie are reuled by huevre’s stròngar,
And as a resulte uie must obeie þis ordre and uirse.
I am baund by þise circomstances—
Iven as I beg þe gods of daiþ for mercie,
I uill obeie þose in pôure; þere’s no sense
In meddling ouere you don’t belongue.
