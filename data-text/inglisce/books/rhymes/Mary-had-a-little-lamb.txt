Mairy had a little lame,
Little lame, little lame.
Mairy had a little lame,
Its fliece uas oît as snoe.

And evriouere þat Mairy uaint,
Mairy uaint, Mairy uaint,
Evriouere þat Mairy uaint,
Ћe lame uas seure to goe.

It folloed her to scoule uan daie,
Scoule oun day, scoule uan daie.
It folloed her to scoule uan daie,
Uich uas against þe reuls.

It mâde þe children laffe and plaie,
Laffe and plaie, laffe and plaie.
It mâde þe children laffe and plaie
To sihe a lame at scoule.

"Oîe dus þe lame love Mairy so?
Mairy so, Mairy so?
Oîe dus þe lame love Mairy so??"
Ћi igre children crîe.

"Oîe, Mairy loves þe lame, you gnoe,
Lame, you gnoe, lame, you gnoe,
Mairy loves þe lame, you gnoe,"
Ћe tiecheur did replîe.
